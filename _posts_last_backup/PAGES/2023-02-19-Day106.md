My body is still adjusting with the physical activities, 
<br>
I am still getting the “day after” body-ache. 
<br>
Its annoying but it is what it is. 
<br>
<br>
Michelle is doing the bi-weekly house cleaning also. 
<br>
That means fresh bedsheets!!!
<br>
which I always look forward when michelle is here. 
<br>
3 loads of laundry done too which is good.
