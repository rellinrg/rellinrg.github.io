My sister just reminded me that Papa's meds maintenance supply today needed to be replenished.
<br>
I usually order this stuff, 2 weeks supply for both mama and  papa.
<br>
I order them separately and alternately every week, 
<br>
So I have to do this ordering often ðŸ˜¬
<br>
Luckily thier medicines can be ordered online via [Mercury Drug](https://www.mercurydrug.com/orderonline.html)
<br>
<br>
So reason for this is that, some medications are the same for both of them
<br>
like tablets for highblood pressure
<br>
My mama is living in our house in the city near her sisters,
<br>
While my papa is staying in  our house in the province, 
<br>
just nearby our old grandparents house. 
<br>
He usually just come and visit my mama in the city every weekends
<br>
<br>
So back to why...
<br>
I use to order thier medications all at once, supply for 1 month.
<br>
And papa wrongly took her medicine with him in the province
<br>
Which makes my mom so annoyed, 
<br>
And Im also annoyed because mama, is complaining to me.
<br>
They are like kids!
<br>
So yeah, I ended up just refill thiers separately so no arguing...
<br>
<br>
I ordered my papa's meds today and noticed an increased in pricing for Aldactone from 16.95 to 18.00 (+1.05)  each and Fenoplex from 38.50 to 39.75 (+1.25)
Everything is just going up these days ðŸ˜§
