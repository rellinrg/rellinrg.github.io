After our surfing session today. I met Wayans brother in law in Canggu Beach.
<br>
He is working on a shop with all those surfing boards for rent.
<br>
Wayan was working before in KUTA which we have done our first surfing experience.
<br>
He just moved a couple of years ago to Canggu to work with his brother.
<br>
<br>
Also today I met a few locals in the beach. As I was talking to him, few of them are called "Wayan" also.
<br>
Just on that day I realise that Wayan is a general term used for "ELDEST" 🤦🏻‍♀️

<br>
Also, 1 thing i learned on todays surf session.
<br>
Always wear a very tight swimming attire when going for surfing, I've learned my lesson today 😬😬😬
<br>
Skimpy bikinis wouldn't do you any good specially when the water waves are so harsh 😱
<br>
I wouldn't elavorate the experience but im sure you got my point yah? 🤪
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wayan Accompany to a Roxy shop. I need to get a new set of beachwear for tomorrow.
<br>
This time, ill have to choose for a secured one 🙄🤣
<br>
<br>
<br>
After that, We had lunch just at the opposite side, theres a restaurant called Warung Mina
