<br>
Its been more than a month since we last play due to rain
<br>
I thought its another stay at home weekend,
<br>
as the rain is pouring every freakin' day.
<br>
I don't mind raining all day while at work,
<br>
<!--more-->
but common, give us a break on weekends...
<br>
which, well, we are given the chance...
<br> 
I almost didnt go out coz it starts to rain at 2pm,
<br>
but weather changed around 3pm, so i did left home after 3
<br>
<br>
A lot of people really was looking forward to be out
<br>
as we had 4 nets full today.

<br>
Im not really playing well though, my serves are shits!
<br>
Mostly all are outs.
<br>
I guess need to get to play a lot more to get back in good game...
<br>
<br>
<br>
After that, we had some dinner at Basil & Tyhmes
<br>
Why always Basil & Thymes? 
<br>
Well, we keep our nets there so Its some sort of give back and show support
<br>
They installed new table tennis too for us to play indoors if it rains...
