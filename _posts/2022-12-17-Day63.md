Was excited to join this event.
<br>
I wasnt a pro player but I believe I wasnt bad either 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
<br>
It ends up only 1 Category for the 2 days tournament.

<br>
I was paired with Jeremy. He is a local.
<br>
Its the first time I played with him. I saw him on the list of players every Saturday morning
<br>
<br>
<br>
Total of 8 pairs joined, 7 matches to play all of them.
<br>
Our first game, with this pair 💪🏼
