It is a lovely sunny day 🌞
<br>
It's been 3 weeks since my last game session that I got my injury.
<br>
I'm glad it wasn't so bad and it healed quickly.
<br>
I am able to play the game normally.
<br>
<br>
After quarantined at home for 8 days due to covid,
<br>
I was longing for social human connections outside work
<br>
Glad to meetup with my beach tennis friends 😊
<br>
<br>
I played 4 game sets which was my number of games target per session which is great.
<br>
The thrilling fun game was the game set 3, 
mixed game with Jeroen and myself vs Francisco and his partner. 
<br> 
and we  won 🏆 
<br>
<br>
Got a shitty last game thou, sorry Vicky 😬
<br>
But over all its a fun one.
<br>
<br>
After the game, we gone for dinner at food republic,
<br>
I was hesitant to join at first, because it would be a temptation 😬
<br>
I am on week 2 on my "no dinner" diet so might hard for me to resist,
<br>
But you know, we need to socialize 🙃
<br>
<br>
It wasnt bad at all!
<br>
I managed to supressed my cravings.
<br>
I opt for a healthy option
<br>
A  popiah and I was fine
<br>
Well, in a way,  pros for my covid experience? It somehow suppressed my apettite
<br>
Looking into positive side despite 🤷
