I joined my office friends for lunch today but I decided to cycle while they are taking bus. 
<br>
It took me 11 minutes to arrive there. 
<br>
Of course I arrived first than them coz the bus waiting time to that area is a bit long.
<br>
<br>
I had Kway Chap set. 
<br>
First time to try this meal.
<br>
It actually taste good. Im surprised.... 
<br>
This meal set in Ciyuan Community Hawker sells at $4.50, not bad right?
