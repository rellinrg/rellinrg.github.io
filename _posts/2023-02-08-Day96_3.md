As Ive browsed the movie listing in nex today,
<br>
I came upon Magic Mike's Last Dance
<br>
the third movie in the Magic Mike series
<br>
Though I didnt watch the first 2 movies,
<br>
<!--more-->
This one I did, just because Its Salma Hayek,
<br>
and because theres nothing much showing in nex
<br>
I think I watch all sorts that has been showing - Hindi/Korean/Chinese
<br>
Ive read the reviews of disappointed viewers
<br>
Because its a downgrade from the first 2 movies
<br>
I think the story was ok...
<br>
I like Salma Hayek, and the dance choreo which they focus more on back flips and tumbling, like Channing Tatum's "Step Up" dance moves back in days
