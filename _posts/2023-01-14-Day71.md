Around 12noon, pirti jud dukaa
<br>
My cousins Aubrey and Shiela are driving,
<br>
They are both new drivers though Shiela got thier car first, ate Aubrey was just driving lately.
<br>
Still on her 1st 100KM ride on her car.
<br>
I was sitting in front seat trying to talk to her so she wont fall asleep on the road.
<br>
Man, I wassss so sleepy. My eyes cant hardly stay awake!
<br>
<br>

We decided to stop by in 7eleven for a coffe break! and found a pandesal shop in the corner

<br>
But found out later on that its just our landmark only.
<br>
We got our accomodation beside HK hotel
<br>
<br>
Arrived in the location at around 2:40pm. Our family and relatives arrived there first as they came from the province
<br>
And we came from city so we just have to meet there.
