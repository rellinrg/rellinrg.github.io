<br>
Done all my errands after work.
<br>
Was walking around Nex Mall, thinking what should I do next.
<br>
I feel a little hungry.
<br>
<!--more-->
I was thinking, should I take away anything or skip the meal as I usually do.
<br>
I pass by Jollibee TWICE then boom.
<br>
I say ~fuck it, Im eating tonight ... 
<br>
So I did...
<br>
Growing up, Jollibee is some sort of special place to kids in my city.
<br>
Its like a happy place...
<br>
Notice they are serving Happy Meals? 
<br>
<br>
Also, Jollibee was my first working place? I think around year 2000
<br>
I was in college and a working student in Jollibee as a cashier
<br>
So it was kind of memorable.
<br>
22 years ago... Who would have thought?
