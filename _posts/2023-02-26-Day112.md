Feeling feverish but my temperature was ok.
<br>
I think this maybe due to the very hot weather yesterday.
<br>
Luckily, its sunday. 
<br>
So lazy day it is.
<br>
<br>
Beto always encourage me to come also on Sunday's
<br>
But this is the main reason I wont!
<br>
I need 1 day of recovery every week
<br>
Coz too much sun makes me lethargic
<br>
<br>
So I ended up watching this old movie in Netflix
<br>
I love Anne Hataway since her movies, the princess diaries 1 and 2
<br>
I keep on re-watching it ðŸ˜Œ
<br>
<br>
Apparently, Love and Other Drugs were actually based on a memoir called Hard Sell: the Evolution of a Viagra Salesman
<br>
<br>
The chemistry between pharma salesman Jake Gyllenhaal and Parkinson's patient Anne Hathaway is there but it sometimes get lost in its sub-plot. 
<br>
Sometimes funny but basically it's a very sad story for a parkinsons patient.
