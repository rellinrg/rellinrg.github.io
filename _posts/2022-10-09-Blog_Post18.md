<br>
Golf wasnt better today.
<br>
We had a 5 long weeks of break and I felt like I am trying to feel the game again.
<br>
I had 1 Par and 1 Bogey today which I am happy about but the score is not really what I hope for.
<br>
I am +4 today which is not great.
<br>
Also I wasnt happy with my short shots using Pitching and Sandwich clubs.
<br>
But enjoy we must coz this is part of the game.
<br>
Better luck next time
