I was looking for an entry level 2-simcards phone
<br>
to accomodate my PH number
<br>
I found this Vivo Y02 in nex for $159 ($149) with $10 discount using ATOME
<br>
Its only 3GB Ram and 32GB Internal storage
<br>
So far, after using it for a week, it is an upright and affordable entry-level smartphone.
<br>
I had a difficulty in adjusting though since Ive been using Iphone for so long
<br>
Its a bit slow so I only install what is essential and necessary.
<br>
Well, minimalist it is...
