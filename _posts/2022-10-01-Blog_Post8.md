Woke up early today to do the accounting for our business.I was having a chill night last night, watching "Love & Gelato" in Netflix so I didn't manage to do these stuff. 
<br>
Also, I've got ticket for MMA Championship in Singapore Indoor Stadium given by Paul. Will be meeting Dorms in the venue

So plan changed. After waiting for so long in the queue, 2nd in line for ticket collection they ran out of ticket, so they need to print more but they cant confirm how much more to wait, so we decided to plan and do other things instead.

Breakfast at subway then home to prep and get my bike. We plan to meet up in ECP
