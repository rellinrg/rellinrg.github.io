Woke up early today to do the accounting for our business.I was having a chill night last night, watching "Love & Gelato" in Netflix so I didn't manage to do these stuff. 
<br>
Also, I've got ticket for MMA Championship in Singapore Indoor Stadium given by Paul. Will be meeting Dorms in the venue

So plan changed. After waiting for so long in the queue, 2nd in line for ticket collection they ran out of ticket, so they need to print more but they cant confirm how much more to wait, so we decided to plan and do other things instead.
<br>
Breakfast at subway then home to prep and get my bike. We plan to meet up in ECP

Exhausted! It was a long day...
<br>
Was caught up with rain while on the way to ECP. Had to shelter under an HDB for almost an hour.
<br>
Rain is unpredictable. After a heavy one, Sun shines suddenly. Managed to continue cycling to ECP.
<br>
Set-up net at 4:30, suddenly rain again after 3 sets waited for 20 minutes or so for the rain to stop
<br>
Back to the game and managed to continue playing till 2 games then it rain again!
<br>
Nah, we are so done. Pack up the nets at 6, had a pint of beer then home.
<br>
Thats basically how I spent my saturday.
<br>
Now im tired. Good Night World
