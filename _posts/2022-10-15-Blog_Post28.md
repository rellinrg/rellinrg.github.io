Its a very hot day!
<br>
After 4 games, I had a very bad headache. I think I am dehydrated.
<br>
Worst thing is, I dont have panadol in my wallet (which I always keep on hand for this cases)
<br>
Where are you when I needed you most? 🤦🏻‍♀️
<br>
Anyway, had to have some cold beer before going home - maybe it will help? so as I thought....
<br>
I still had the headache going home so I had to take a cab with my bike instead for tonight.

By the way, I tried "Chicken Pad Thai" in Basil and Thymes, It wasn't bad at all 👌
