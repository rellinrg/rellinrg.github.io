One small positive thought in the morning can change your whole....
<br>
And so I did.
<br>
It was raining so hard when I woke up at 5am.
<br>
I think around 7am rain has slowly stop.
<br>
Looking outside by my balcony, it still looks wet but i think rain stops.
<br>
and so i thought...
<br>
Picked up my bike and heading out for work
<br>
And suddenly..... small droplets of water falls in my face 😑
<br>
I am like 4 minutes away from home.
<br>
Should I go on? 
<br>
Risk and hope the rain is just a passing wind?
<br>
My ❤️ is saying,  yeah lets do it 💪🏻
<br>
But my 🧠 is saying otherwise...
<br>
Lets choose the safe side shall we?
<br>
So yeah, I end up parking my bike in Kovan MRT and took the train ususual 
<br>
When i reached in the office, rain wasn't so bad.
<br>
So i thought to myself, I should have risk it, should I? 🤷
