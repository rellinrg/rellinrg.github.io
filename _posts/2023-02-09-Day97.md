<br>
I started feeling my throat sore again, 
<br>
It wasnt really painful, but I am feeling the little pressure
<br>
Also the pressure in my ear which is connected to it.
<br>
Plus I woke up few times last night, 
<br>
suddenly felt like grasping my breath,
<br>
Felt like my left side of my esophagus tube was choked
<br>
I panicked, the usual panicky that I am...
<br>
I managed to feel at ease and sleep back again.
<br>
And then I was dreaming.
<br>
It was kind of wierd, I was having lunch with 2 ladies
<br>
I dont know them but they are very comforting
<br>
then after that I seem to go in a place, it looks like a restaurant
<br>
I was welcomed with a lot of young people that looks like working in a kitchen 
<br>
wearing different kind of white clothes
<br>
I dont know, I seem to apply for a job in there
<br>
but the next thing I was joining them, I was welcomed wholeheartedly
<br>
I was calm. They were all smiling at me. I was too.
<br>
Its the first time that I dreamed something like that,
<br>
Like Seeing unfamiliar faces. And still remembering them.
<br>
Somewhat mixed races all together and I got along with them
<br>
Then...I woke up when my alarm rang.
<br>
Back to reality. 
<br>
Somehow that dream calmed me.
