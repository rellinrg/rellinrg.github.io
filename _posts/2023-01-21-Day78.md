Long sleep I had
<br>
But felt like my body is quite heavy!
<br>
Got up and showered.
<br>
Even prepped, wearing my beach tennis clothes
<br>
but feeling so tired around 2pm and end up fallin asleep
<br>
Beach Tennis cancelled for me today
<br>
Will just sign up for tomorrows session

<br>
Had some matcha tea and chocolate cupcake in Coffe Bean in NeX Mall
<br>
Coz its the only place and starbucks opened that day
<br>
Aside from chinese restaurant, that is a long queue on this day
