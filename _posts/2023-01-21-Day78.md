Long sleep I had today
<br>
But felt like my body is quite heavy!
<br>
So I got up and showered
<br>
Even prepped, wearing my beach tennis clothes for the day
<br>
but feeling so tired around noon and end up fallin asleep on the couch
<br>
Seems like beach tennis will be cancelled for me today
<br>
Will just sign up another session on the next day.
<br>
<br>
<br>
By 5, I had some matcha tea and chocolate cupcake in Coffe Bean
<br>
Coz its the only place as well as starbucks opened that day
<br>
Aside from chinese restaurant, that is a long queue on this day
<br>
Chinese New Years Eve seems to be thier busy day.
