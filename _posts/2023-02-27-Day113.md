Bought this Bicycle bag last year for $60, can't remember when
<br>
But used it for once or twice only I think.
<br>
<!--more-->
<br>
It's not very comfortable when its on
<br>
It makes my front wheel unstable
<br>
So i decided to remove it and keep it for a while
<br>
But I never look back, never putting it back
<br>
So I posted it in Carousell for $30 
<br>
And I get an offer of $20 
<br>
So I let it go
<br>
And let another human being make use of it at its full extent
