Its a bonding time with family today. After All the errands, travel here and there, today should be just a lazy chill day.
<br>
<br>
I booked a grab for us to go in SM City. Kuya Grab driver has explained to us that Kids are already counted as 1 head in grab car so he negotiate with us that we need to add on for this. Well, good to know about this new rule 🙄

Clouds looks amazing today 💭💭💭💭

We then brought the kids to the playground and left them there with my sister then me, my 2 sisters, mama and papa then proceed to play Bingo 😂😂😂

<br>
Too bad, we never did win 😅

After that, we had our lunch in a Seafood Restaurant just on the same level of the Bingo area. It was a nice meal...
