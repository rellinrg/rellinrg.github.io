I left early from home to look for bike shop which is open on Sundays.
<br>
My regular go to bike shop is closed on sundays so I have no choice. My pedal needs changing like ASAP .....

<br>
Found an open shop while I was on my way to Beach Tennis Session.

Replacement of the pedal cost $6 and bought a new bike seat also for $25
