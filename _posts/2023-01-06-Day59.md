<br>
Few days of sleepless nights,
<br>
I managed to get a longer sleep last night.
<br>
I guess my mind just pass out
<br>
Exhausted itself to operate
<br>
<br>
<br>
Its my sisters birthday today, my Dad on 24th and My niece just last new year, on 1st 
<br>
January was my highest % of my expenses last year
<br>
Hope to pull down a bit this year, its one of my goal after all
<br>
<br>
<br>
But speaking of goal,
<br>
How can I?
<br>
My auntie and cousins has arrived from Canada
<br>
We will be having reunion next week
<br>
Home usually equals 💰🤦🏻‍♀️
