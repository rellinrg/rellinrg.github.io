<br>
Finally weather is quite good today.
<br>
Cycled early going to EastCoast. I thought Im the ealier one but I wasnt.
<br> 
Im around 10 minutes behind by Andrew. Setup early and do some warm ups.
<br> 
The waiting was quite long tho, I was tired already from the warm up.
<br>
Around 4:20, Olivier arrived and so we started the proper game.
<br>
Packed up the nets around 6:30 as the sun sets early today.
<br>
Had some beers at atmosphere then headed home.
<br>
I still have to prep my clubs for golf tomorrow but really cant be bothered now... Too exhausted...and sleepy
<br>
So i guess ill have just to wake up very early to do that...
<br>
So Good Night Folks XxX
