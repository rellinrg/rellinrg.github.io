Chapter 1/365
<br>
<br>
Every year, we make a resolution to change ourselves
<br>
But this year Ill focus in being myself...
<br>
<br>
<br>
I woke up early in the morning to start my day right
<br>
Cleaning up my room, Vacuuming the floor and hanging up my laundries.
<br>
As my old grannies have told us, if we start being deligent on new year,
<br>
We will be deligent throught the year 
<br>
Ofcourse who wants a lazy kid around 😅
<br>
<br>
<br>
Done my financial review and clear the expenses so I can start a new one today.
<br>
I cant believe how high is my expenses last year
<br>
Its not even a full year journal coz I started a lil later already last year.
<br>
My target this year would be to see a decline of my expenses between last year and this year
<br>
Cross finger on that 🤞🏼
<br>
<br>
<br>
I started to enjoy more on exploring bringing along my gopro,
<br>
Maybe because I want to capture more on life as it happens
<br>
Its something to look back
<br>
To reminisce...
