Ive finally done my massage today. After 2 days of surfing, my body deserves it 💆🏻
<br>
My arms are a bit sore due to the never ending paddling in the beach.
<br>
I think the early morning in the beach also helps to totally cure my cough.
<br>
<!--more-->
I wasnt coughing at all since day 1 in Bali. 
<br>
<br>
I do remember when we were young, when we get cough, late lolo (grandad) brought us in the beach early in the morning
<br>
He said salty water helps to loosen up any phlegm in your chest and cough it out all. And he was right 😌
<br>
So growing up we became very fond of the beach. Everytime we go back in the province, we always have some time to go to the beach.
<br>
<br>
So back to my story 🤭
<br>
After our failed plan to go sightseeing in SAVAYA BEACH CLUB, we ended up going for a dinner in Shipwreck restaurant.
<br>
It wasnt the best "last" night. No parties and all but I guess I was just ready to have a restful night after waking up early to surf today.
