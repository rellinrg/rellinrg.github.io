I don't know you, but really this is the shittiest super hero movie I ever watched!
<br>
I have a very low standard in the movies I like,
<br>
but even so, It wouldn't pass on me...
<br>
<br>
I love the real-like monsters on the near to end part tho.
<br>
Apart from that, nahhh
<br>
<br>
PS:
Only my opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️
