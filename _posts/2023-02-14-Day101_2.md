I had very little sleep today fixing the site
<br>
Somehow last night, New markdown files created wouldnt show in the post
<br>
I was only trying to fix the images not loading, 
<br>
ends up the entire post page was not working!
<br>
Slept like 2am already because of it 😴😴😴
<br>
Still not working until like 9am.
<br>
And I have no idea why it works either!
<br>
Arrrgggh....
<br>
<br>
<br>
So Ive realised that the photo embedding on site seems to be not working properly on mobile
<br>
which causes the slow loading or crash of the app.
<br>
I am trying to use embedded frame,
<br>
It seems to work for a few posts but after embedding quite a lot of photos,
<br>
It seems to slow back down again 🤦🏻‍♀️
