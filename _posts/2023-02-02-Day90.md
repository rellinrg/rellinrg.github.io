<br>
The doctor gave me 2 days MC yesterday
<br>
But I felt bad not to work on the 2nd day
<br>
So I did come to office
<br>
Felt better than yesterday but I am still shivering within
<br>
<br>
<br>
They are decorating the building for tomorrows CNY event
<br>
The head of HR just announced that theres apple and samsung phones for raffle draw prices
<br>
I guess everyone is excited to attend..
<br>
So as me.....
