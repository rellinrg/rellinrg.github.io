<br>
I asked whats the specialty and she said its Biryani.
<br>
So I said, ok, will try it 👌
<br>
I usually dont go out on my comfort zone in terms of foods 
<br>
Its not that im so "masilan" but I just dont want to be disapppointed
<br>
I will regret if it turned out that I dont like it
<br>
But i think its time to explore and try everything.
<br>
If you dont, youll never know 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
as what they said, 
<br>
"THERE ARE NO REGRETS IN LIFE
<br>
"JUST LESSONS"
<br>
<br>
I had  hard time choosing in the menu anyway, so a recommendation would be the only option 🤣

<br>
<br>
So Biryani Lapis Power it is!
<br>
I choose with "Kambing"
<br>
Kambing is mutton she said.
<br>
<br>
In Tagalog, kambing is goat 🐐, 
<br>
<br>
In my dialect in Cebu, We call it Kanding
<br>
