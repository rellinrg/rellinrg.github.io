Friday it is... Its very quite in the office.
<br>
Most of the peoples are working from home, but not me.
<br>
Good for them. 
<br>
So me and CH was busy debugging the VNC server which until now is a white elephant...
<br>
White Elephant - It means something whose cost of upkeep is not in line with its usefulness or value.
<br>
We got the server few months back but still not functionally working until this time.
<br>
Actually, this server is not under my support but yet, still, I wanted to push it to make it work.
<br>
Well, anyway,still not ready and its making us busy today.
<br>
Being busy is not bad tho.
<br>
You wont notice the time.
<br>
Ok, So why Cinnamon?
<br>
Well, Im craving for it.
<br>
I saw an old friend posting it in her facebook. 
<br>
I used to buy some tasty bread and dessert from her.
<br>
So i pinged her, that I missed her sweets.
<br>
She said she still has a tray of cinnamon
<br>
I LIKE !!!
<br>
So i ride a bike under the sprinkling rain just to get that cinnamon!
<br>
And so i did....
<br>
It wasnt bad... Its worth it...
