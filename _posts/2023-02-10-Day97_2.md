<br>
DBS Paylah was launching a $3 subsidy in hawker shops today
<br>
Initially we dont know this when we had our lunch
<br>
But gopal mentionened that he just got a cashback as he paid his dessert,
<br>
so we dig in checking on.
<br>
And yes we found out about it
<br>
Its nice of DBS to offer this promotion, and its for a year somemore!
<br>
Every friday, until January 2024 for the first 100,000
<br>
Isn't it great?
