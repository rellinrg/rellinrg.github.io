[Lyrics](https://prolyrical.com/you-wanna-pay-your-bills-you-wanna-pay-rent-lyrics/)
<br>
You Wanna Pay Your Bills
<br>
You Wanna Pay Rent
<br>
You Wanna Get Starbucks
<br>
You Better Work Bitch
<br>
<br>
You Wanna Get Groceries
<br>
You Wanna Feed Your Cats
<br>
You Wanna Watch Netflix
<br>
You Better Work Bitch
