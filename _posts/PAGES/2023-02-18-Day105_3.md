GG 💪🏼
<br>
1st game was so lit man!
<br>
I was nailing it. To think that I was match with good player guys.
<br>
Scored 5 - 5 , with 40 (deuce) for last set.
<br>
It was so freaking thrilling
<br>
Paired with Faz and our opponent was Gavin and Ramon
<br>
<br>
2nd Game Im still on fire 🔥
<br>
Like lots of energy. 
<br>
Faz was like jokingly saying how many red bulls did i drink today, I was like 1 😆
<br>
<br>
And he was like really? no wonder so burning with energy 😂
<br>
I was already paired with Lin on the 2nd game while our opponent was Faz and Janice and we got score of 6 - 3 👊🏼😌
<br>
3rd Game, was still me with Lin vs Janice and Elise. We won with a 6 - 5 score. 
<br>
<br>
I was already exhausted after 3 games. had a 1 game break then last game with Ramon Vs Janice and Elise.
<br>
I had little energy left to run to 😮💨
<br>
We lost by them and Score 3 - 6 whew
