<br>
17 peoples attended today in Beach Tennis session.
<br>
4 new faces that I've seen who joined.
<br>
1 was a tourist from Korea that was just here for few days
and bump to our group.
<br>
It's kinda refreshing to meet new peoples every now and then 
<br>
<br>
My first game was with Olivier Vs Faz and Shirley
<br>
We won  🏆 with score 6 ~ 1 
<br>
<br>
2nd game, We swap partner, 
<br>
Me with Faz Vs Olivier and Shirley
<br>
And still won 🏆 with score 6 ~ 4
<br>
<br>
It was a very sunny day.
<br>
My skin was like burning!
<br>
After just 2 games, I felt exhausted and took a break while other team playing
<br>
<br>
3rd game, gone to other net and play with the new faces.
<br>
I am with Kyle, the korean tourist, 
<br>
while Faz with Ben
<br>
It was a thrilling game coz both of the newbies actually do play Tennis
<br>
Which is actually a good background to play beach tennis
<br>
Me and Kyle won 🏆
<br>
with score 6 ~ 5
<br>
We are in the breaking point of 40~40
<br>
<br>
4th and 5th game was with Carol,
<br>
Carol is brazilian.
<br>
She was so damn competetive that if you are partnered with her, you will be pressured 😬
<br>
She's very fit that she looks like those volleyball players 
<br>
And she plays well too, thou she trashtalks a lot with Aldin 🤭
<br>
But anyway, looks like just a friendly trashtalk. 
<br>
Both of them, Aldin and Carol are Seloso players
<br>
So they seldom come in ECP to play
<br>
Anyway, yeah for that last 2 games,
<br>
It was girls vs boys, so Aldin and Faz Vs Me and Carol
<br>
We lost with a score of 2 - 6
<br>
Had a full game set break again,
<br>
Then last, revenge game again with a score of 1 - 6 
<br>
Its still a good game tho,
<br>
Coz trying to return balls from these guys are actually a good practice 💪
