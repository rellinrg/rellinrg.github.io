Checked out Ghazrin Hotel.  
<br>
All I can say is, 
<br>
<br>
What an experience! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
<br>
<br>
I have an entry here about being locked in [Locked in](http://rhearellin.com/Blog_Post39/)

You cant complain too coz by far, its the cheapest accomodation ive seen in booking.com
<br>
I love hostel hopping coz for me, the easiest way to explore is at the surrounding of your accomodation

This hostel is only about $16 , Its single bedroom but shared bathroom. No aircondition either. Only fan
<br>
I heard a lot of noises around 3am or 4am who just checked in.
<br>
I think the only advantage of this place is its just behind Larkins Station. 
<br>
Those people that arrived like after midnight from a long travel stays for the night.
<br>
As long as theres bed, you can sleep, that should be fine. 
<br>
<br>
Would I like to try again this place? ahh not... If I need to travel, and need to be so early in Larkin, I might just stay in [ATTRUS Bed and Breakfast](http://rhearellin.com/Blog_Post36/) take a grab to Larkins ðŸ˜Œ
<br>
<br>
But hey, its good to try to know how it is...
<br>
Expectations VS Reality ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­

Anyways, thats all for this place.
