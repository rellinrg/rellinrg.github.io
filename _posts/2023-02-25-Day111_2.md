<br>
It was an easy ride despite me having a break for a long time in cycling.
<br>
It's been a while since my last long ride there,
<br>
I think its been few months since rain started to pour last year
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I am back into it !!!
<br>
Hope the weather will go along with me...
<br>
<br>
I also did a survey in fair price marine parade if they have all the BBQ equipments we will need this coming saturday.
<br>
I did book the BBQ pit for this event and will be one of the hosts,
<br>
So I need to make sure we can just find the stuff there.
<br>
Anyways, it has so were good
