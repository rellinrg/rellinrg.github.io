<br>
I spent a good chunk of time decluttering
<br>
And still have a long way to go before I can consider myself a minimalist
<br>
Slowly travelling in the path of decluttering. 
<br>
A lot of stuffs have already been relocated in new homes,
<br>
<!--more-->
And still a lot to be sorted out.
<br>
There is no right, or wrong way to do it,
<br>
The important thing is realizing and recognizing that the most important things in life,
<br>
were never things.
