Checked out Ghazrin Hotel.  
<br>
All I can say is, 
<br>
<br>
What an experience! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
<br>
<br>
I have an entry here about being locked in [Locked in](http://rhearellin.com/Blog_Post39/)
<br>

You cant complain too coz by far, its the cheapest accomodation ive seen in booking.com
<br>
For me, the easiest way to explore is the surrounding of where you stay in.

This hotel is about $16 , Its a little less than [ATTRUSS BED AND BREAKFAST](http://rhearellin.com/Blog_Post36/) but the difference is SUPER HUGE!
<br>
I heard a lot of noises around 3am or 4am who just checked in.
<br>
I think the only advantage of this place is its just behind Larkins Station. 
<br>
Those people that arrived like after midnight from a long travel stays for the night.
<br>
As long as theres bed, you can sleep, that should be fine. 
<br>

Expectations VS Reality ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­

Anyways, thats all for this place.
<br>
