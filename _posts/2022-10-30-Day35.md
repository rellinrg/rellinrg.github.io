<br>
Just 3 days after I was in Raffles Clinic, 
<br>
I am back again with different health issue.😕
<br>
<br>
Was jokingly chatting with the doctor,
<br>
<br>
Saying Im already a regular here due to frequent visits 🥲
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was coughing a lot at dawn and had a stuffy/runny nose plus a low fever
<br>
<br>
Flu got me! 
<br>
<br>
Doctor also took a covid test just in case,
<br>
Since Flu symptoms are also unfortunately same symptoms for covid+
<br>
<br>
<br>
Result was negative so wereeee good.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Was feeling tired and drowsy early in the evening tho,
<br>
At 7pm I already am down in bed.
<br>
<br>
I am given 3 days MC but I have to go to office tomorrow as my colleage is on leave. 
<br>
<br>
Its either he or I will be present so. no choice 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
<br>
<br>
Will have to rest well today to forcefully be recovered tomorrow 🙏🏼💪🏼
