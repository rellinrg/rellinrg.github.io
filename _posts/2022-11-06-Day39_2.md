Its a very hot day. I forgot how hot cebu could be...
<br>
<br>
We planned to meet up in my house in Deca Homes. Which is a subdivision in Talisay City.
<br>
<br>
My parents used to leave in this house but end up moving to a small home nearby to her sister as this place is a bit far from the city.

Sweats are dripping while my nieces are enjoying the cold water in a mini tub to beat the heat
