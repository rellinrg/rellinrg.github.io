<br>
She's imperfect, but she tries
<br>
She is good, but she lies
<br>
She is hard on herself
<br>
She is broken and won't ask for help
<br>
She is messy, but she's kind
<br>
She is lonely most of the time
<br>
She is all of this mixed up
<br>
And baked in a beautiful pie
<br>
She is gone, but she used to be mine
