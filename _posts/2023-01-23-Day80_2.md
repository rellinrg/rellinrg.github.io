<br>
It's not simple to say
<br>
Most days I don't recognize me
<br>
These shoes and this apron
<br>
That place and its patrons
<br>
Have taken more than I gave 'em
<br>
It's not easy to know
<br>
I'm not anything like I used to be
<br>
Although it's true
<br>
I was never attention sweet center
<br>
I still remember that girl
<br>
She's imperfect but she tries
<br>
She is good but she lies
<br>
She is hard on herself
<br>
She is broken and won't ask for help
<br>
She is messy but she's kind
<br>
She is lonely most of the time
<br>
She is all of this mixed up
<br>
And baked in a beautiful pie
<br>
She is gone but she used to be mine
<br>
It's not what I asked for
<br>
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
<br>
And carves out a person
<br>
And makes you believe it's all true
<br>
And now I've got you
<br>
And you're not what I asked for
<br>
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
<br>
For a chance to start over
<br>
And rewrite an ending or two
<br>
For the girl that I knew
<br>
Who be reckless just enough
<br>
Who can hurt but
<br>
Who learns how to toughen up when she's bruised
<br>
And gets used by a man who can't love
<br>
And then she'll get stuck and be scared
<br>
Of the life that's inside her
<br>
Growing stronger each day
<br>Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
<br>
To bring back the fire in her eyes
<br>
That's been gone but it used to be mine
<br>
Used to be mine
<br>
She is messy but she's kind
<br>
She is lonely most of the time
<br>
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
<br>
She is gone but she used to be mine
