<br>
I booked a BBQ pit in ECP since January
<br>
And finally it is today
<br>
I am assisting Beth in hosting....
<br>
<!--more-->
<br>
Its raining since morning so actually, the plan is we decide on that day
<br>
If weather permits, we can just buy meats for grilling in parkway parade
<br>
Just right before the underground tunnel to ECP.
<br>
<br>
It was already about 3pm that I areached home from Ubi 1 to get my orders
<br>
And beth was asking me to get a rope for the Waterproof canvass cloth she has,
<br>
We can use it as a tent for the BBQ pit area,
<br>
Just prioritize that area.
<br>
So I did...
<br>
<br>
Reached in ECP about 5:30
<br>
Rain is not so bad so we setup the Canvass as a tent

<br>
Also brought along this buthane stove that I bought few years back in planning to have a maybe picnic in ECP
<br>
But never happened. Atlast it can be used! It was still packed and sealed but the buthane was rusting so I was kinda scared to used it myself
<br>
I told Beth about it, and she was so brave to do it herself ðŸ˜¬. It turns out OK and working fine. I managed to make hotpot on it
<br>

<br>
Ended with enough food. So I think it was a success.
