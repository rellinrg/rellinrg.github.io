I booked a BBQ pit in ECP since January
<br>
And finally it is today
<br>
I am assisting Beth in hosting the event.

<br>
Its raining since morning so actually, the plan is we decide on that day
<br>
If weather permits, we can just buy meats for grilling in parkway parade
<br>
Just right before the underground tunnel to ECP.
<br>
If rain will be heavy, then cancel 🙅🏻‍♀️
<br>
<br>
It was already about 3pm that I areached home from Ubi 1 to get my orders
<br>
And beth was asking me to get a rope for the Waterproof canvass to serve as tent,
<br>
We can use it and prioritize to cover the bbq pit area.
<br>
<br>
Reached in ECP about 5:30
<br>
Rain is not so bad but still needed a roof cover for the pit so we setup the canvass. It was a daunting hurdle in setting it up since theres no proper places to tie the roof up, but we managed to make it work.

Also brought along this buthane stove that I bought few years back in planning to have a "maybe" picnic in ECP
<br>
but never happened. Atleast it can be used... It was still packed and sealed but the buthane was rusting so I was kinda scared to used it myself
<br>
I told Beth about it, and she was so brave to do it herself 😬. It turns out OK and working fine. 
<br>
I managed to make hotpot on it
<br>

Ended with enough food. So I think it was a success.
