I am carrying the trays of food, so I am not cycling to ECP. 
<br>
Not even taking train to Payah Lebar,
<br>
coz I just cant take the long walk to the interchange as theres no direct going ECP. 
<br>
So its the first time I take bus and will see how long is the travel.
<br>
<br>
<!--more-->
And these what i jot down....
<br>
Left Home 3:05
<br>
Kovan MRT 3:16
<br>
Serangoon MRT 3:19
<br>
Serangoon BUS Stop 3:26
<br>
Bus 43 Arrived 3:38
<br>
Opposite Parkway Parade Bus Stop 4:15
<br>
Arrived in ECP 4:30
<br>
<br>
About 1.40 minutes travel time if taking a direct bus going to ECP.
<br>
Its long, but i think its comfortable specially bringing lots of stuff.
<br>
I dont mind long trips, Ill just have to sitdown in the 2nd level of the bus
<br>
and do my journal
