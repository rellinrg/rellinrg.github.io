<br>
Its a waste of holiday.
<br>
Ive been watching a lot of "Naruto" today
<br>

<br>
<br>
Tried ordering grab foods for late lunch
<br>
But it was cancelled twice after hours of waiting
<br>
My Dunkin Donuts arrived thou so thats good. atleast.

Had enough with grabfoods and gone to nex mall instead.
<br>
Rain is not so heavy anymore, just a little drizzle.
<br>
Had take away Egg Fried rice from WOKHEY
<br>
The shop is just too small though and only cater takeaways,
<br>
Remembered 4th Floor rooftop has benches to sit down there,
