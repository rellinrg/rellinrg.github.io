📍 Singapore 📍
<br>
<br>
Just 1 week interval and I have to fly again 😅
<br>
<br>
I am still not feeling so energetic after arriving from CEBU. I caught a really bad cough
<br>
Like really really bad. Its the worst cough I felt since forever 😭
<br>
I've been strucked with sleepless nights. The cough seems to be worst at night.
<br>
Ive been tracking my health and it worries me, I was worrying that it might be covid but its not.
<br>
I guess Its just a worst cough ever!
<br>
<br>
So I was really hesitant to go for this travel. Im afraid I will keep on coughing on the plane.
<br>
Luckily when the flight day came, only left with a little residue of cough. 
<br>
<br>
I took half day leave on the flight day as our flight's boarding time is supposed to be 17:10
