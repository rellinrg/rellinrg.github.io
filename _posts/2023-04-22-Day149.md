🎶 Heart beats fast 🎶
<br>
🎶 Colors and promises 🎶
<br>
How to be brave
<br>
🎶 How can I love when I'm afraid to fall 🎶
<br>
🎶 But watching you stand alone 🎶
<br>
🎶 All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow 🎶
<br>
<br>
🎶 One step closer 🎶
<br>
<br>
🎶 I have died everyday, waiting for you 🎶
<br>
🎶 Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years 🎶
<br>
🎶 I'll love you for a thousand more 🎶
<br>
<br>
<br>
Damn this song! [A thousand years](https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28835976/Christina+Perri)
<br>
<br>
This very song from Twilight Saga is now playing in this Cafe called Soil_Jb 
<br>
Oh I love this song... I am a die hard fan of Edward and Bella (Kristine Stewart and Robert Pattinson)
<br>
Makes me remember that wedding scene in the movie...
<br>
<br>
Anyway, same as this hidden cafe in JB,
<br>

The A mbiance was so great and desserts were superb. It is so relaxing + the choice of music is 👌
<br>
<br>
I had Creme Brulee Tart and Canole de Bordeaux along with black coffe to balance the sweetness
<br>

<br>
Creme Brulee was so yummy, not much a fan of the canole tho.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This cafe is located in Springlab Taman Ekoflora JB
<br>
81100 Johur Bahru
<br>
<br>
Tried commuting coming here right after immigration
<br>
But google map's direction was so wrong,
<br>
<br>
I had to take bus and forth on the terminal coz a wrong direction 🤦🏻‍♀️
<br>

<br>
<br>
So correct bus to take is T11 and stop in Jalan Daya, Taman Setia Indah
<br>
Its basically the last stop of that bus, about 50 minutes travel time
<br>
Then from there I took a grab for RM7.00 to Spring Lab
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was too hungry by then as its already almost 12nn,
<br>
I only had protien Shake for breakfast 😬
<br>
<br>
So I had breakfast in an Indian Restaurant just opposite of the bus stop.
<br>
Had some prata, Nasi Lemak and Kopi O for RM13.00
<br>
Not bad👌
