<br>
Heart beats fast
<br>
Colors and promises
<br>
How to be brave
<br>
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
<br>
But watching you stand alone
<br>
All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow
<br>
<br>
One step closer
<br>
<br>
I have died everyday, waiting for you
<br>
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
<br>
I'll love you for a thousand more
<br>
<br>
<br>
Damn this song! [A thousand years](https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28835976/Christina+Perri)
<br>
This very song from Twilight Saga is now playing in this Cafe called Soil_Jb 
<br>
Oh I love this song...
<br>
Makes me dream of happy endings....

Creme Brulee was so yummy, not much a fan of the canole tho.

This cafe is located in Springlab Taman Ekoflora JB

<br>
Tried commuting coming here right after immigration
<br>
But google map's direction was so wrong,
<br>
<br>

<br>
So correct bus to take is T11 and stop in Jalan Daya, Taman Setia Indah
<br>
Its basically the last stop of that bus, about 50 minutes travel time
<br>
Then from there I took a grab for RM7.00 to Spring Lab
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was too hungry by then as its already almost 12nn,
<br>
I only had protien Shake for breakfast 😬
<br>
<br>
So I had breakfast for an Indian Restaurant just opposite of the bus stop.
<br>
Had some prata, Nasi Lemak and Kopi O for RM13.00
<br>
Not bad👌
