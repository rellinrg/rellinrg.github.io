<!--more-->
I promised to join my office friends for lunch today
<br>
So I did...
<br>
<br>
I cycled to Ciyuan Hawker and meet them there.
<br>
They were taking bus.
<br>
The travel is just about 10minutes
<br>
So its not so bad...
<br>
<br>
I ordered Kway Chap set.
<br>
Its about $4.50 meal and it was a great one.
<br>
It has braised duck, pork belly, pig innards, beancurd, and hard boiled eggs
<br>
<br>
Some people might not like pig innards tho...
