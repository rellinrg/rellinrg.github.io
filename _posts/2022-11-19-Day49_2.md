📍 Singapore 📍
<br>
<br>
I also signed up for this event, Its the same timing with the 21Days challenge tho, So basically, my cycling timing auto-upload also on this event.
<br>
<br>
So how it actually works is, whatever event I signed up for on that day, my timing will automatically update on specific events.
<br>
<br>
If i there's 2 events at the same time, then it will upload on both events.
<br>
Cool right? 🙃
<br>

No need manual submission. Strave App do all of this 😃👌🏼
