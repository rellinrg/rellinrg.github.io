I have read it online that expressing gratitude in everyday can help combat depression.
<br>
It says that a single thoughtful appreciation leads to an immediate 1ncrease in happiness and a decrease in depressive symptoms.
<br>
When it becomes a habit, It can help prevent anxiety and depression...

<br>
I have a lot to be thankful for
<br>
But oftentimes, we neglect all these when we have negative emotions built inside 
<br>
I am starting this habit of writing a journal of gratitude everyday
<br>
Hopefully i can keep up in a month or more ðŸ˜¬
