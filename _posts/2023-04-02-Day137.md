I have read it online that expressing gratitude in everyday can help combat depression.
<br>
It says that a single thoughtful appreciation leads to an immediate 1ncrease in happiness and a decrease in depressive symptoms.

When it becomes a habit, It can help prevent anxiety and depression...
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a lot to be thankful for
<br>
But oftentimes, we neglect all these when we have negative emotions built inside 
<br>
I am starting this habit of writing a journal of gratitude everyday
<br>
Hopefully i can keep up in a month or more...
<br>
<br>
PS. Was just reminded of this popular song in TikTok
<br>
Lord I thank you for SUNSHINE
<br>
Thank you RAIN,
<br>
Thank you for JOY,
<br>
Thank you for PAIN
<br>
Its a beautiful day
<br>
Its a beautiful day
