Friday the 3rd. 
<br>
I wasn't prepping or bringing any home-made meal today.
<br>
I usually join my lunch buddies usually on this day.
<br>
To be connected with my office social circle.
<br>

<br>
Dormine has offered for a transport to Lucky Plaza
<br>
As she said, she can reinburst it,
<br>
So we decided to have our lunch there.
<br>
It's been a long time I haven't been in Lucky Plaza.
<br>
I felt like the city area is a bit too far for me,
<br>
So I only go there if there's important thing to go for.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, travel was a little over 30minutes going there by car.
<br>
As soon as we get there, we set foot to the 4th floor where there is this filipino restaurant
<br>
But our muslim friends doesnt seem to like any of the food,
<br>
So we decided to just go in the basement foodcourt.
<br>
But ofcourse I did buy a lot of filipino desserts "kakanin" before we come down.
<br>
<br>
I ordered Mega Combo Meal at Max's All About Chicken for $13.60
<br>
It comes with Hicory BBQ Chicken, Lumpia Shanghai, Java Rice, caramel bar and a drink.
<br>
THE BEST 👌🏼
<br>
Max is very known in PH but I normally dont eat there.
<br>
I am amazed with the BBQ chicken taste.
<br>
In terms of chicken, I usually go to Mang Inasal,
<br>
This one is almost level as Mang Inasal
<br>
So thumbs up 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
