📍 Canggu Beach 📍
<br>
<br>
<br>
I woke up at 5am today as Im planning to go surfing early.
<br>
The waves was not so good yesterday. It was so flat.
<br>
They said an earlier one maybe best so ill try.
<br>
<br>
Took a grab bike to Canggu Beach. 
<br>
Cost me only about $3 for 10.88KM ride.
<br>
It just amazed me how cheap the transpo from point A to point B. 
<br>
In Singapore, this far, will easily cost me $15-$20
