Going to see my Family today since covid hits. It was 2019 when I last travelled back.
<br>
<br>
I am flying light (which means, I only have a carry-on lugguage) so I have to buy chocolates in Cebu DutyFree already for pasalubong. 
<br>
The whole fam has a sweet tooth 🍫🍫🍫

Its a very hot day. I forgot how hot cebu could be...
<br>
<br>
We planned to meet up in my house in Deca Homes. Which is a subdivision in Talisay City.
<br>
<br>
My parents used to leave in this house but end up moving to a small home nearby to her sister as this place is a bit far from the city.
