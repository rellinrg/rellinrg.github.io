Just back Massage!
<br>
<br>
Oh man...
<br>
That was a great one.
<br>
I feel so relax now after a whole day of walking
<br>
<br>
<br>
Checked in by 4pm and settled myself
<br>
Rested and slept for about 2hrs
<br>
Showered, then walk out
<br>
<br>
I've checked in this same location for few times but never really walk further than 1KM
<br>
And so I did...
<br>
<br>
<br>
**LAPTOP CHARGER**
<br>
So I just realized that I left my laptop charger at home. 
<br>
Funny thing is, I already packed that charger last night but then took out again this morning 😬
<br>
So most probably, this post won't be completed today and will have to post it when i get home...
<br>
<br>
<br>
**ABLE TO SUPPRESS MY IMPULSE BUYING**
<br>
I passed into few shops today, one was that shop with that cute nice journal notebook that I kinda like
<br>
Also that shop with a girly bling bling.
<br>
I admire them, but feeling like those girly stuff doesnt fit my personality anymore, I dont know 😆
<br>
<br>
<br>
**WRITE MY POST IN COFFEESHOP**
<br>
I am supposed to, but then I realized,
<br>
I will be tempted to eat some desserts again
<br>
NO...NO... for me on evenings!
<br>
<br>
<br>
**A TREAT**
<br>
Saw a sleeping beauty face mask and told myself, why not?
<br>
lets do it tonight before bed 😏
<br>
<br>
<br>
**JAVANESE MASSAGE**
<br>
Well, I wasnt really planning to do it tonight
<br>
While I was on my way bach home,
<br>
It just presented itself along the way 🙃
<br>
Love the massage,
<br>
Except the tickle when shes massaging my fit
<br>
and some part of my back 
<br>
I was trying so hard not to laugh visibly 😂😂😂
<br>
<br>
It was an hour massage for RM85.00
<br>
Just right in the exit/entrance of City Square -near KOMA Mall
