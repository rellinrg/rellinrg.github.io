Just back from Massage!
<br>
<br>
Oh man...
<br>
That was a great one.
<br>
I feel so relax now after a whole day of walking
<br>
<br>
<br>
I Checked in by 4pm and settled myself in.
<br>
Rested and slept for about 2hrs as felt so exhausted after a long walk.
<br>
Showered, then walked out again.
<br>
<br>
I have checked in, on this same location for few times but never really walk further than 1KM
<br>
And so I did...
<br>
<br>
Walked around and reached Komtar mall,
<br>
Then I exited at the end and entered citysquare.
<br>
While I was walking, a lot of things come to my mind,
<br>
like....
<br>
<br>
**LAPTOP CHARGER**
<br>
So I just realized that I left my laptop charger at home. 
<br>
Funny thing is, I already packed that charger last night but then took out again this morning 😬
<br>
So most probably, this post won't be completed today and will have to post it when i get home...
<br>
<br>
<br>
**ABLE TO SUPPRESS MY IMPULSE BUYING**
<br>
I passed into few shops today, one was that shop with that cute nice journal notebook that I kinda like
<br>
Also that shop with a girly bling bling.
<br>
I admire them, but feeling like those girly stuff doesnt fit my personality anymore, I dont know 😆
<br>
<br>
<br>
**WRITE MY POST IN COFFEESHOP**
<br>
I am supposed to, but then I realized,
<br>
I will be tempted to eat some desserts again
<br>
NO...NO... for me on evenings!
<br>
<br>
<br>
**A TREAT**
<br>
Saw a sleeping beauty face mask and told myself, why not?
<br>
lets do it tonight before bed 😏
<br>
<br>
<br>
**JAVANESE MASSAGE**
<br>
Well, I wasnt really planning to do it tonight
<br>
While I was on my way bach home,
<br>
It just presented itself along the way 🙃
<br>
Love the massage,
<br>
Except the tickle when shes massagingmy fit
<br>
and some part of my back 
<br>
I was trying so hard not to laugh visibly 😂😂😂
<br>
<br>

It was an hour massage for RM85.00Jusright in the exit/entrance ofCity Square -near KOMTAR Mall
<br>
This is the first time that I savor the feeling,
<br>
Release the stress and think about anything in life while my masseuse was doing her magic
<br>
<br>
Despite all the circumstance that I encountered,
<br>
Life is great.
<br>
And I am thankful 🙏
