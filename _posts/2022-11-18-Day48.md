📍 Richards Place 📍
<br>
<br>
After waiting for so long! ( About 1.5 years ) It has arrived 😇😇😇
<br>
<br>
I know, I have promised myself to focus on downgrading stuff but this one will make life easier, Ill make an exception 😆 
<br>
Its time saving, cost effective and fully portable. Small but mighty 💪🏻
<br>
<br>
Small enough to fit on your countertop, but big enough to effectively wash all your dishes from a meal for 2 , much more for someone living alone 👌🏼
