<br>
Happy New Year's Eve!
<br>
<br>
We are already standing in a brink of a new year
<br>
It was a roller coaster ride 2022!
<br>
<br>
#1 My ultimate goal for 2022 is to get rid of stuffs
<br>
"Less is More"
<br>
I believe throughout the year, I have slowly done that.
<br>
And I learned to detached myself on material possessions, not quite all but I think a lot 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
I do follow the rules of donating/decluttering stuff before buying a new one, 
<br>
Its hard at first, but I guess overtime I slowly adapted it.
<br>
<br>
#2 Financial Freedom
<br>
This one is really hard to tackle
<br>
I am in between of wanting to save "for the future" and "life is too short"
<br>
I dont even want to argue about this area.
<br>
I had a few friends that suddenly breath thier last without enjoying the fruits of thier labor
<br>
So I guess I have a long road for this goal.
<br>
<br>
<br>
A roller coaster of ride it was 2022
<br>
Feeling lost, confused and empty. I struggle in finding meaning of my life
<br>
I guess being Isolated took a toll on my mentality on the fast years when Covid starts
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I will try to Kick off New Year Right 🆕
<br>
<br>
NR#1: More solo travels (budget travels) 
<br>
NR#2: More in control of my finances
<br>
NR#3: Be consistent on my daily blog
<br>
NR#4: Be more with less A.K.A a minimalist
<br>
NR#5: More active in sports/hobby
<br>
<br>
Its the first time that I make a specific new years resolution this time. 
<br>
Hope I can hold into it.
<br>
<br>
Till next year
