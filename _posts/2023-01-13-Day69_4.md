I had a very uncomfortable sleep in the plane
<br>
For some reason, the seat seems to be very stiff
<br>
Gasakit jud akong li-og.

<br>
Landed around 5AM in Mactan Cebu International Airport
<br>
Also realized that I forgot to apply for eTravel System
<br>
Luckily, they change the process now.
<br>
You can just scan this and apply on arrival
<br>
Got to include this on my "To do" list next time to save time.

Arrived in my Condo at 6am, had a quick nap then had to go to the bank to pick up my debit card replacement which I applied last November.
<br>
Took me so long to get a cab, weather was not good, always raining. Cab services are congested.
<br>
Luckily after many times of searching for grab car, I caught one.

Just on the way to Deca Homes. Got my BPI card , bought a new padlock for my house in Deca Homes then get a transpo going home. Tricyle driver is trying to rip me off asking for Php200 going inside the subdivision whereas taxi starts only at Php175. Tricycle is almost same as toktok in Thailand
