<br>
<br>
Up early to cycle
<br>
Need to clear up my mind a little
<br>
I was initially planning to cycle to the beach and sit down,
<br>
feel the sea breeze and offload my emotions
<br>
But it started to rain when I reached kembangan.
<br>
<br>
My thought was maybe, Ill just find a coffeshop,
<br>
Have some coffe but realized I didnt bring any cash/card with me
<br>
Just brought along my phone
<br>
Oh well...
