My cross stiching supplies arrived!
<br>
<br>
I was thinking of other hobby to do and Cross Stitching come up in my mind.
<br>
<!--more-->
Cross-stitch is a form of sewing and a popular form of counted-thread embroidery in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance.

Hopefully I don't get bored easily on this ðŸ¤«
<br>
And complete a few projects, and make a collection...
