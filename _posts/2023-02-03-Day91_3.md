<br>
After the event, Its early release from work
<br>
So I decided to visit Claire and Roj to check out and test thier mini drum set
<br>
I tried this drumming in virtual land gaming and I find drumming interesting
<br>
Just nice when I was with Melai there, they invited me to come for a music session
<br>
And I think i like it! I might pursue to practice this one too.
