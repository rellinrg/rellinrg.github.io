<br>
I visited the clinic for Initial check of my back.
<br>
Clinic was so busy that I am on #43 in queue  😵
<br>
<br>
Doctor was saying its a Sebaceous Cyst 
<br>
And no need to worry because its mostly not cancerous, which is a relief to hear 
<br>
<!--more-->
I can opt to remove or not to remove, 
<br>
but the only option to remove it, is thru surgery 
<br>
I am total scared of surgery 🤕
<br>
But sooner or later, I might need to....
<br>
<br>
I complained about the pain
<br>
The doctor said, might possibly infected which cause the pain
<br>
So I was given antibiotic to take and will see if it the pain stops after the full course
<br>
Man I've been taking so much antibiotic this month  😵‍💫
