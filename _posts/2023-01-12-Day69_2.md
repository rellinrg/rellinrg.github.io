Left for Aiport by 10pm so I still have some time to walk around.
<br>
Travel was about 29minutes from home to Terminal 4 so not so bad.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Checking-in was fast also, In Singapore, mostly its automated.
<br>
Again, I was stopped in bagagge checked after immigration 
<br>
due to my small nail clippers and tiny scissor in my small sewing kit.
<br>
For me, nail clipper is a necessity coz I often got this dry skin at the side of my nails that always peels off,
<br>
which is sore and annoying every time - so this is non negotiable 
<br>
The tiny scissor, in the other hand, maybe I can....
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was hungry after I cleared the check-point and its annoying
<br>
coz I just eat a whole cup of nissin noodles around 8ish!
<br>
So walk around, I found Coffe Bean... check check check
<br>
Changed my mind! Didnt I say to be frugal this year?
<br>
So proceeded on the 2nd floor which has foodcourts, didnt fancy anything there
<br>
Walk more and found 7 eleven at the end corner
<br>
<br>
<br>
Go for Egg and Cheese Sandwich instead heated in microwave
<br>
For "$2.99" I was full and energised
<br>
<br>
