So to continue with my story today...
<br>
I found out that him and my Burmese friend was together in the training.
<br>
He did some digging to checked the emails.
<br>
Theres only 2 emails of male attendee.
<br>
One with profile and the other without and the one with the profile doesnt look like him and he is offline.
<br>
The other doesnt and already online. So what are the odds?
<br>
I ping the the guy hoping he is the one.
<br>
And bwalah! He was the right one.
<br>
Ive said my THANK YOU atleast.
<br>
He saved me from the hassle of requesting a new one, waiting for days and all.
<br>
Also, I badly needed it to enter the Data Center.
<br>
So yeah, Thank you :)
