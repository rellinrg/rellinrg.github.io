WHAT A COINCIDENCE!!!
<br>
So I try to retrace my walkway yesterday while I was going home to check if I may have drop my badge before boarding in BUS 315.
<br>
Didn't found any. So I ask the reception/guard if someone has reported any badge and at the same time, I need to borrow a temporary badge instead if no one has found.
<br>
Just as about to ask the guard, he was telling me that Samuel is looking for me "The facility manager" . So I have a hint already ðŸ˜‡
<br>
Someone found my badge and returned! yay!
<br> 
The guard said a guy from AMK1 - the same building as I am
<br>
So yada yada yada while on the way to the elevator, my Burmese friend arrived and I told him about what happened blah blah.
<br>
He asked me who found it and all but I said, I dont know, someone from the same building found it.
<br> 
And suddenly, someone from the elevator just spoke... Its me!
<br>
OMG, that was so funny and coincidental! We are just talking about this someone, and here he was!
<br>
I was shooooocked. hehehe. Just amazed how the universe put together this stuff.
<br>
Anyway, We are about to go out in the elevator when he break his silence.
<br>
I just had a quick "Thank you", I didnt even managed to ask his name coz things happened super FAST!
<br>
So next, is to find out who he is! LOL
