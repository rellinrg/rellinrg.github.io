<br>
Our trip back to the city was an adventure itself.
<br>
There is a reroute of road passing by in CarCar
<br>
We end up, we lost our way while doing our turn.
<br>
Ended up somewhere in the seaside.
<br>
<!--more-->
It was so dark that we couldnt see the road signs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
We arrived almost 10pm in the city,
<br>
Our cousin has to drop us up on the highway
<br>
So we have to get a cab going inside the subdivision.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Transport is always a problem for us in going anywhere.
<br>
We already are 6 people, (My dad, mom, me and 3 sisters plus the 3 kids) 
<br>
So always 9 of us when going out.
<br>
We cant even fit in a 6 seaters car anymore coz the kids nowadays are counted as 1
<br>
So I always have to book 2 cabs everytime we go out. 
<br>
Its very hard to get a cab as my place is very inside near the seawall already plus its very expensive! 
<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point of my life, I still cant afford a car
<br>
I still had 2 mortgages to clear
<br>
So will have to make do for whatever we have for now
<br>
Life is not about material things 
<br>
And yet we still need convenience,
<br>
If I, myself alone, I can do the commuting
<br>
but not with the rest of the family, much more with the kids.
<br>
Oh well, in Gods timing we will üôèüèº
