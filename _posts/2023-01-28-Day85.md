Its a very wet day again....
<br>
Melai was quite lucky that for the two days she's here,
<br>
the weather was very good to her that theres no sign of rain when she was here.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was planning to prep tacos yesterday
<br>
<!--more-->

<br>

<br>
Coz the lettuce are already wilting

Im glad it works!
