Its a very wet day again....
<br>
Melai was quite lucky that for the two days she's here,
<br>
the weather was very good to her that theres no sign of rain when she was here.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was planning to prep tacos yesterday
<br>
but we are out all the time,
<br>
I guess its a tacos day then
<br>
Coz the lettuce are already wilting
<br>

<br>

<br>
Im glad it works!

Been copying files all day so I can get rid of this skeletal disk
