Time checked: 7:54pm

Meeting with the Europe people just finished. I felt exhausted.
<br>
I am entally drained...
<br>
<br>
I still havenâ€™t really fully recovered with sleep. I woke up at 3am this morning with diarrhoea. Cant recall what I have eaten that causes it ðŸ¤”
<br>
Aside from using the wrong socks for the shoes I am wearing today to work, nothing much going on except I have blister today ðŸ˜‘

Also , I realized that its easier to write my blog in notes while I am still thinking about it.
<br>
Somehow it eases up my exhaustion a little rather than end of the day wherein I am so exhausted ðŸ˜´
