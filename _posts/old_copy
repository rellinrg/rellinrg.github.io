<br>
<br>
Its again Monday.
<br>
9th day of the year 2023
<br>
<br>
Started this behavior lately, that I start counting days
<br>
My friends often misinterpret it as some countdown of celebration or holidays
<br>
But I am not sure really what Im counting of,
<br>
Just an urge feeling to make my days accounted for.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Most of my days, I fill it with plans
<br>
Doing this, doing that and other else in a span
<br>
<br>
When my calendar is full,
<br>
My thought somehow  were fooled
<br>
<br>
What is the meaning of someones existense?
<br>
Can it only be achieved by having persistence? 
<br>
<br>
Just a thought on Mondays
<br>
