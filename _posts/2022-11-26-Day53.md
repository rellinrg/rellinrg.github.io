📍 Furama Xclusive Ocean Beach 📍
<br>
<br>
Today is a surf day! 🏄🏻‍♀️
<br>
I contacted our old friend Wayan for a refresher on surfing, so he will pick me up today in our hotel. 
<br>
He moved to a different workplace in Canggu Beach which he is going to introduce me today.
<br>
<br>
I quickly grab something first before Wayan will pick me up. 
<br>
The hotel breakfast timing is 7:30-10:30 - I was the first one to be there at 7:21am 🤭
