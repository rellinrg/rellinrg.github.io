_Thu Oct 27 15:55:54 +08 2022 . Holland Village . Singapore_
<br>
<br>
I took the morning off to go for my X-ray in Raffles Holland Village.
<br>
Raffles Nex dont have the necessary equipment to do the screenings so I was endorsed to the other clinic branch.
<br>
<br>
So a little bit of story time, while going to Holland Village... 
<br>
As we all know, nowadays, It is very scary/embarassing to cough on public transport
<br>
If you do that, people will be like staring at you like you are contagious 😥
<br>
<br>
So while on the train, 
<br>
I have experience a mild episode of chocking.
<br>
Somehow I swallowed and felt like in the wrong way.
<br>
So by right, our instinctive reaction in such situation is to cough which is usually sufficient to rectify the situation.
<br>
<br>
BUT what if you are taken the freedom to do this too?
<br>
<br>
Yeah right? Imagine trying to hold on that cough when you are slowly choking 😰
<br>
I waited for the next train stop to get down while trying to hold into it...
<br>
It was the longest ride I felt that it seems like forever.
<br>
Man it felt miserable 😮‍💨
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately its one of the side effect of this pandemic.
<br>
It somehow affect us in other aspects of our lives.
<br>
One way or the other  😔
<br>
<br>
<br>
BUT yes, Im a survivor 
<br>
<br>
(Intermission) 😆
<br>
I'm a survivor 🎶
<br>
I'm not gon' give up 🎶
<br>
I'm not gon' stop 🎶
<br>
I'm a survivor 🎶
<br>
I'm gonna make it 🎶
<br>
I will survive 🎶
<br>
Keep on survivin'
<br>
<br>
So yeah, I did stop in Caldecott MRT (Which is new to me too)
<br>
Stop, Cough and drink some water...
<br>
After a few minutes, I felt better and continue my journey
<br>
<br>
I stop in Holland Village MRT and just follow the route to shopping center.
<br>
The outside environment looks new to me.
<br>
Ive never been in that part of Singapore 
<br>
(oh except when that night before pandemic that we go for a bar around Holland Village)
<br>
Well, its different when you get a cab at night and go directly to a bar, rather than walking at daylight and seeing the sorrounding road itself.
<br>
Ive been in Singapore for a decade but I felt alienated sometimes like this area for example 😳
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, yun lang naman, na kwento ko lang 🤭
<br>
<br>
Raffles Medical Clinic is just opposite of Holland Village MRT
<br> 
Inside Holland Village Shopping Mall in 5th Floor
<br>
So its easy to find.

<br>
<br>
Once result is out, they will just send it to my doctor in Raffles Nex so I just need to wait for a call from them.
<br>
<br>
so crossfingers 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
