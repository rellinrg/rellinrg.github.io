When we choose to own less, 
<br>
We value and appreaciate what we own more,
<br>
Because what we keep is special to us or useful.

According to Mari Kondo, 
<br>
“If you are letting go of an item, giving thanks is also a way of properly saying goodbye, 
<br>
so that you can mark the end of your relationship with the item and release it without guilt. 
<br>
It’s a way to recognize your relationship with your possessions.”
<br>
<br>
And I think this is a good way of thinking.

I remember buying this one in Vietnam back in 2014
<br>
Been keeping it since then.
<br>
So thank you and good bye... 
<br>
The new owner was a very grateful old man, 
<br>
cycling in my home to pick up this stuff. 
<br>
Whether he will use it, or sell it, 
<br>
I just hope It helps him in any ways.
