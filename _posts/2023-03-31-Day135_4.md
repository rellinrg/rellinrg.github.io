<br>
I almost thought that I could get my expense target goal this month
<br>
But ends up not.
<!--more-->
<br>
<br>
Though I learned to be frugal,
<br>
Theres some high unexpected expenses that arises this month too which are necessary like Medical Expenses. 
<br>
Fixing my watch was costly too...
<br>
<br>
Its been a struggle physically and emotionally this month
<br>
But hey, what doesnt kill you makes you stronger yah
<br>
<br>
Hopefully next month will be better
