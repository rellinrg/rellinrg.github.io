Woke up today with a grateful heart ❤️
<br>
My foot injury has gotten better
<br>
I am able to walk properly, tho still feeling a little pain,
<br>
It is not so bad and tolerable.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Had to wake up at 6am today to prepare for my health screening
<br>
Im surprised how I changed in terms of my fear on getting health checks,
<br>
specially if it involves drawing blood.
<br>
Somehow, I overcome my fear and anxiety
<br>
<br>
So back to my health Screening,
<br>
We have a standard corporate screening free from our company,
<br>
For the past 7 years, I ignored it
<br>
As I am scared to know whatever health issues I may have
<br>
This time, I finally took it due to my back cysts infection
<br>
TopUp my standard screening for an executive one 
<br>
So I can do more and extensive tests
<br>
<br>
