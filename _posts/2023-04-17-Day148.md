<br>
Woke up today with a grateful heart ❤️
<br>
My foot injury has gotten better
<br>
I am able to walk properly, tho still feeling a little pain,
<br>
It is not so bad and tolerable.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Had to wake up at 6am today to prepare for my health screening
<br>
Im surprised how I changed in terms of my fear on getting health checks,
<br>
specially if it involves drawing blood.
<br>
Somehow, I overcome my fear and anxiety
<br>
<br>
So back to my health Screening,
<br>
We have a standard corporate screening free from our company,
<br>
For the past 7 years, I ignored it
<br>
As I am scared to know whatever health issues I may have
<br>
This time, I finally took it due to my back cysts infection
<br>
TopUp my standard screening for an executive one 
<br>
So I can do more more extensive tests
<br>
<br>
<br>
After all the tests and procedure,
<br>
I just had my meal since 6pm yesterday.
<br>
On the ground floor in Paragon, 
<br>
there is this cafe called "GreyHound"
<br>
I ordered Mushroom Panini Sandwich and It was theeeeee best sandwich I ever tasted
<br>
I am not a fan of Sandwiches or Burgers but this one is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
<br>
<br>
<br>
After my meal, sat down there for maybe an hour
<br>
And worked on my laptop.
<br>
It was when it started to be very busy that I started to wrap up
<br>
Felt so awkward working on there, thou Im not the only one
<br>
but still...
<br>
<br>
On the way back home, I passed by in Adidas Shop
<br>
Well, I had a plan before of getting a new shoes
<br>
But my minimalist mind kicked in 🙌🏼
<br>
30 days rule baby... think about it first and see how
<br>
So I left the shop empty handed...
<br>
Damn, congrats girl, you made it out 🥳
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just as I was about to board in Doubygaut Station going home,
<br>
The radiologist in MinMed called me to redo an abdomen scan
<br>
As the gall bladder scanning was not so clearly taken
<br>
I was required to go back there
<br>
Unfortunately, I had my Mushroom Panini already
<br>
Oh My!
<br>
I need to fast again for another 4 hrs to do the ultrasound again
<br>
What a Panini 😱😱😱
<br>
<br>
So never mind, I said
<br>
Ill go back home and take a rest first
<br>
And come back about 3:00pm
<br>
Just nice 4 hrs after my Panini 😅
<br>
<br>
So around 3:30pm
<br>
I was back and do the ultrasound again
<br>
Unfortunately, my gall bladder seems still small
<br>
And didnt expand so Its too small to be seen in ultrasound
<br>
Oh well. Not much we can do...
<br>
I'll have to come back again on 24th morning after an evening fast
<br>
<br>
What a Panini Day 🤦🏻‍♀️
