I was not feeling good last night
<br>
I already felt a little off yesterday, was just thinking maybe its due to very cold weather that I shivers at work
<br>
But even home, I felt worst
<br>
No aircon, I was just using fan, covered with few layers of cloth,
<br>
<!--more-->
But the chills were very persistent and bone deep
<br>
Its just annoying to feel vulnerable.....
