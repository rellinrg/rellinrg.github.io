<br>
It was quite a long travel...
<br>
Its not because its very far but its because its very busy yesterday
<br>
A lot of people from Singapore was coming in Malaysia.
<br>
I kind of expected it already coz I have come here a lot of times.
<br>
<br>
Left office at 4:55pm - arrived in Woodlands MRT at 5:51
<br>
Its an hour ride of bus + MRT
<br>
Its where I usually take bus (bus 950), going in Malaysia.
<br>
There is also bus 160/170 which you can board in Kranjie MRT,
<br>
but I prefer the Woodlands one.
<br>
<br>
<br>No seats in MRT going to AMK - so standing the whole time...

<br>
Its been a long time I never commute to Malaysia.
<br>
Its a lot of changes happening around the sorroundings.
<br>
The location of Bus 950 has been temporarily relocated also.
<br>

<br>
<br>
The long queue started already when waiting bus 950. I have to wait for the 2nd Bus to board.
<br>
<br>
Leaving and entering Singapore is quite fast because there is a lane for pass holder which you just need to scan.
<br>
The nightmare starts when you are going through Malaysia Immigration.
<br>
The crowd is crazy. As you enter the checkpoint area, you will be overwhelm seeing these whole bunch of people.
