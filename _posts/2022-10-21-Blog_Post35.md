<br>
It was quite a long travel...
<br>
Its not because its very far but its because its very busy yesterday
<br>
A lot of people from Singapore was coming in Malaysia.
<br>
I kind of expected it already coz I have come here a lot of times, its not a surprise.
<br>
<br>
Left office at 4:55pm - arrived in Woodlands MRT at 5:51
<br>
Its an hour ride of bus + MRT
<br>
Its where I usually take bus (bus 950), going in Malaysia.
<br>
There is also bus 160/170 which you can board in Kranjie MRT,
<br>
but I prefer the Woodlands one.
<br>
<br>
Its been a long time I never commute to Malaysia.
<br>
I noticed a lot of changes happening around the sorroundings so its a bit of exploration again on the area.
<br>
The location of Bus 950 has been temporarily relocated also.

<br>
<br>
The long queue started already when waiting bus 950. I have to wait for the 2nd bus to board.
<br>
<br>
Leaving and entering Singapore is quite fast because there is a lane for pass holder which you just need to scan your passport and boom. done.
<br>
The nightmare starts when you are going through Malaysia Immigration.
<br>
The crowd is crazy. As you enter the checkpoint area, you will be overwhelmed seeing these whole bunch of people.

<br>
The queue was like a snake! You have to find the end of the circling tail to start the queue.
<br>
At first, I landed on the wrong tail. It was the queue for Malaysian Permanent Residence. 
<br>
So take note people ‚òùÔ∏è
<br>
When entering Malaysia, always go directly to the last few lanes...
<br>
You'll never go wrong, Its for "All Passports" lane.
<br>
Though Im sure that I queued for the "All Passports" lane, I still ended up in that lane ü§î
<br>
<br>
Completed in 1.5hrs in immigration and took a grab to my hostel.
<br>
Yes, hostel... I do love hostel hopping when I travel.
<br>
Different location got different experience.
<br>
Whether good or bad, Its still an experience isn't it? üòÑ
