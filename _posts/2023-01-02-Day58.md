Chapter 2/365
<br>
<br>
<br>
Woke up at 7am today.
<br>
I tried to sleep more but I just cant
<br>
<br>
I ended up uploading/editing my videos from my recent trip in Malaysia
<br>
<!--more-->
It was a lot of short videos.
<br>
I was searching for a good editing software not knowing I can use the built-in on my windows
<br>
So I ended up using Clipchamp Video Editor in windows
<br>
It was not bad for basic editing, will see until I completed it
<br>
<br>
<br>
Day just gone so fast. I got tired of sitting in front of my laptop for hours
<br>
Took me hours to compile the video clips!
<br>
Wanted to push myself to go out and walk around but ended up watching Netflix
<br>
I just picked something new to watch on Netflix and tried watching "Wedding Season"
