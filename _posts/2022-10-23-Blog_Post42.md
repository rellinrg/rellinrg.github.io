After checking out from Ghazrin, I took a cab to my next location.
<br>
Its around skudai which is a little far from the city center.

I dont know what to expect on the area. A little far from the city perhaps quite and a bit secluded?
<br>
But I was wrong....
<br>
<br>
The hostel is easy to find... The cab drop me off just in front of the place.

<br>
<br>
The entrance is in the 2nd floor of the building.
<br>
<br>
The ambiance feels very warm.
<br>
Very neat and clean.

I am surprise that the area is a bit lively.
<br>
Lots of shops, restaurants, cafe's, bar and more. Also nearby in Sutera Mall
