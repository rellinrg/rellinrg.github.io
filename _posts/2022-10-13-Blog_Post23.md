Home. Not tired but no energy.
<br>
On the TV and start up netflix
<br>
First movie that shows up in the suggested screen is a Filipino movie DOLL HOUSE.
<br>
Ive saw a lot of people posting about it.
<br>
Curiosity kicks in so I watch it.
<br>
<br>
Indeed a tearjerker.....
<br>
<br>
<br>
This line in the start just caught me off guard -
<br>
"Only those who has unfinished business are not ready to die tomorrow"
<br>
ðŸ˜¶
<br>
I guess one way or the other, we do have unfinished business ðŸ¤·
<br>
Sometimes we are not fully aware of it....
<br>
<br>
<br>
WHAT IF YOU KNEW THAT YOU WOULD DIE TOMORROW?
<br>
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I LIVE MY LIFE  AT THE RISK OF DYING AT ANY TIME AND THATS CALLED LIFE.....
<br>
