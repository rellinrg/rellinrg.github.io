Time flies so fast! Hindi mo lang namamalayan, 9 days ka na pala sa vacation mo 😪

I was feeling so exhausted. My body haven't really recuperated since travelling to Malaysia 3 weeks ago. 
<br>
Pero its OK, I'll be back to Singapore soon. I can try to rest when i get back.

Before going inside the terminal to check-in, I have to stop over to buy pasalubong to my colleages.

As we pride ourselves as the city's best Lechon - where this Lechon really originated 🤷🏻‍♀️
