📍 Mactan Airport 📍
<br>
<br>
Time flies so fast! Hindi mo lang namamalayan, 9 days ka na pala sa vacation mo 😪
<br>
<br>
I was feeling so exhausted. My body haven't really recuperated since travelling to Malaysia 3 weeks ago. 
<br>
Pero its OK, I'll be back to Singapore soon. I can try to rest when i get back.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Before going inside the terminal to check-in, I have to stop over to buy pasalubong to my colleages. 
<br>
As we pride ourselves as the city's best Lechon - where this Lechon really originated 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
<br>
I had to walk in Terminal 1 to buy coz the shop is only in Terminal 1 Arrival, but why only in Arrival? 
<br>
I think most of the departing passengers need this more than the arriving 🤔

<br>
<br>
I bought 1KG only as Im afraid it will be confiscated by Singapore immigration 😬
<br>
1Kg cost P900.00 (about 23sgd)

Walking back to Internation Departure, catching a quick glimpse of the airport. 
<br>
It has changed a lot. For the better ofcourse!
<br>
The infrasturucture has greatly improved.

I was feeling hungry and decided to grab some dinner before boarding. It will be midnight when I arrive Singapore.

Meal was great + coconut which is so refreshing.

It will be a cold flight....
