Attrus Bed & Breakfast
<br>
82, Jalan Trus, Johor Bahru
<br>
<br>
Checked in ATTRUS BED & BREAKFAST last night.
<br>
<br>
It was only 1.3KM away from Malaysia Immigration.
<br>
I was too tired to walk and find the place so I just booked a grab to the place.
<br>
Did you know that you can use your grab points also in Malaysia?
<br>
Grab charged RM6 for the trip but I paid RM0, nice!
<br>
<br>
Checked in around 9:30pm. 
<br>
The place looks great for $19 ($18.65) to be exact....

They have separate dorms for Ladies and Gents. The Ladies Dorms' main door is password protected, so its safe from unauthorized people, mainly from Gents dorm.

They will give you this bag which have a towel, key, toothbrush and earplug. You'll have to return this with the used towel to get back your RM50 deposit.

As a traveller myself, Ive learned how to make ways to safeguard your belongings specially when checking in on hostels with no privacy and security for your stuff.
<br>
Bought this anti-theft backpack from [pacsafe](https://int.pacsafe.com/) many years back.

<br>
And if you decided to leave it in your bed for the day, make sure that Its attached to any object that is unmovable.

<br>
Over all, this place is recommendable. 
<br>
Locationwise âœ…
<br>
Moneywise âœ…
<br>
Cleanliness âœ…
<br>
<br>
And oh! did I mention that they have free coffe and/or tea in the house? Yes ðŸ˜Œ
<br>
I was too tired already last night to go out for a meal, after all those queueing... So i just had tea before bed.
