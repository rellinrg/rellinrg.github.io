Checked in ATTRUS BED & BREAKFAST last night.
<br>
It was only 1.3KM away from Malaysia Immigration.
<br>
I was too tired to walk and find the place so I just booked a grab to the place.
<br>
Grab charged RM6 for the trip but I paid RM0,
<br>
Did you know that you can use your grab points also in Malaysia?
<br>
I did find out just last night.
