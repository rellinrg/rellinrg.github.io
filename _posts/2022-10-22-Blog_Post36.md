Checked in ATTRUS BED & BREAKFAST last night.
<br>
It was only 1.3KM away from Malaysia Immigration.
<br>
I was too tired to walk and find the place so I just booked a grab to the place.
<br>
Did you know that you can use your grab points also in Malaysia?
<br>
Grab charged RM6 for the trip but I paid RM0, nice!
<br>
<br>
Checked in around 9:30pm. 
<br>
The place looks great for $18

They have separate dorms for Ladies and Gents. The Ladies Dorms' main door is password protected, so its safe from unauthorized people, mainly from Gents dorm. 
<br>
They will give you this bag which have a towel, key, toothbrush and earplug. You'll have to return this with the used towel to get back your RM50 deposit.
