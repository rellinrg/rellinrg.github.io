2 sets of nets has been set up for the beach tennis today.
<br>
Weather was not so bad,
<br>
Its windy, but I prefer this more than a super sunny day 🌞
<br>
<br>
I meet new players too.
<br>
Andy, Rupert and there`s this another guy, i forgot his name (kiork, kirk?)
<br>
damn my memory loss is getting worst!😬
<br>
Anyway, he brought along his wife and baby girl,
<br>
pretty cute!!! little cheerer she is 👏
<br>
<br>
Thats the good thing about this group, 
<br>
You meet different kind of people,
<br>
Different Nationalities,
<br>
Different walks of life,
<br>
But one thing we have in common
<br>
**The passion towards this sport 🎾🎾🎾**
<br>
<br>
<br>
I played 4 game set, which was my weekly exercise target 💪
<br> 
Then had some dinner at Basil & Thymes with them.
<br>
Opps! and broke my 2 months "alcohol" fasting too 🤦🏻‍♀️
<br>
Oh well. It was a refreshing evening tho...
<br>
I had some Irish ale and mango salad
<br>
A match made in heaven 🤤
<br>
Sour and spicy and a hint of sweetness. Perfect!
<br>
