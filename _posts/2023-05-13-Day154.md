2 sets of nets has been set up for the beach tennis
<br>
Weather was not so bad. 
<br>
Its windy but I prefer it more than a super sunny day.
<br>
<br>
New players I meet today too.
<br>
Andy, Rupert and there`s another guy, i forgot his name (kiork, kirk), damn my memory loss is getting worst! 😬
<br>
He bring along his wife and baby girl,
<br>
pretty cute!!! little cheerer she is 👏
<br>
<br>
I played 4 game set, which was my weekly exercise target 💪
<br>
Then had some dinner at Basil & Thymes.
<br>
Broke my 2 months "alcohol" fasting too 🤦🏻‍♀️
<br>
I had some Irish ale and mango salad
<br>
It was a match made in heaven 🤤
<br>
<br>
Sour and spicy and a hint of sweet. Perfect!
<br>
