<br>
This is where I grow up.
<br>
In my grandparents house.
<br>
My cousins were living in the city
<br>
And every time they come over on holidays or vacations,
<br>
We all gather together in this house.
<br>
<br>
<br>
When we were young, this staircase is our morning stop-over when we wake up
<br>
Its like having a coffe to wake up your senses,
<br>
We sit down here while looking at our grandma preparing our breakfast in the kitchen
<br>
<br>
<br>
I miss those days...
<br>
I miss you grandma ðŸ¥º
