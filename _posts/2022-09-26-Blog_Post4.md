Just got home. 
<br>
Nothing much happening today. Busy lang sa work.
<br>
Got a lunch invite with a friend from Beach Tennis, "Claire" so I met her at Nex Mall.
<br>
We had lunch at an Italian Restaurant "Saizeriya" at kunting chikka about life and happenings.
<br>
We haven't talk much after that one time she joined Beach Tennis pero we connect in Instagram.
<br>
Glad to have catch up with here :-)
