Tuesday de fourteenth . 
I was getting crazy frustrated because my site wasn’t working properly which I wanted to. 
<br>
Its us usual rainy day 
<br>
Titanic was re-released today
<br>
though timing is really very early at 7:30pm, theres a hefty chance that I cant make it due to work coz sometimes users are really a pain complaining their work issues every almost after work 🤨
<br>
So I put it to chance …. and I did make it…
<br>
<br>
<br>
The movie was 3.15 hrs long.
<br>
I do remember watching the old version In VHS tape back in days , thou I couldn't remember much of it, I think the ending with the old lady, was a different take of that 1997 film. I'm not sure on my take on the fictional love story between Rose and Jack coz really, who falls in love in 4 days and wants to die together for it? <br>
So it just doesn't make any sense 
<br>
<br>
Honestly, the movie is devastating. We all know that its real and it happened.
<br>
As for me, I have a phobia in drowning. I experienced near death with drowning on my childhood so I am terrified when watching it. 
<br>
Though I like to surf and be in the beach, I have that fear... 
<br>
I just couldnt imagine on that critical moment in time, how devastating it is. 
<br>
If you are one of that people that are left in that splitting ship. Seeing death eye to eye, what a terror could be!
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am so engrossed on it that I cried. Actually I do on all sad movies, Laugh when its funny and super kilig when I'm watching romance movies hence I dont watch a horror film or a brutal killings, coz it will play over and over in my mind. Its a nightmare. While watching movies, my subconscious mind can’t distinguish between fantasy, fictional and reality. I guess its my coping mechanism. Escaping from reality... 
<br>
<br>
Its a great movie. I wouldn't shed a tear if its not. Its a heavy feeling after watching it. So i guess if you are feeling sad you will feel more...well sad 🤷🏻‍♀️... 
coz 101% it will overshadow with what you are feeling
<br>
<br>
<br>
And btw, this movie is in 3D. I didn't really enjoy wearing 3D glasses on cinemas tho. I think Its best if they had released it in non 3D.
I tried my quoola for the first time in cinema too. Its a wearable with instant heating coz cinemas are really chilly unfortunately I wasnt prepared, I didnt charge it on so I have not used it for a long time so cant say much if its useful. Initially I bought this last year for travel coz I just hate cold. details in here --> [quoola](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eyespa/eyespa-spa-massager-that-refresh-your-eyes?ref=195y5a)
