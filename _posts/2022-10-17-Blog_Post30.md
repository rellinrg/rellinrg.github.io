I really need a day between Sunday and Monday 🤔 
<br>
I dont feel like moving around specially Aunt Flo is around
<br>
It feels like angry little ninjas that are trying to "zorro" me inside out 🤺
<br>
Anyways, As lazy as I am today, I am glad that Data Center is stable today that my partner at work is not around.
<br>
No issues from servers, storages, networks and users.
<br>
So its a little relax in the office.
<br>
<br>
I also had the chance to sort out on my financials today.
<br>
I have to start organising my finances.
<br>
A goal without a plan is just a wish 👩🏻‍💻
