Attrus Bed & Breakfast
<br>
82, Jalan Trus, Johor Bahru
<br>
<br>
Checked in ATTRUS BED & BREAKFAST last night.
<br>
<br>
It was only 1.3KM away from Malaysia Immigration.
<br>
I was too tired to walk and find the place so I just booked a grab to the place.
<br>
Did you know that you can use your grab points also in Malaysia?
<br>
Grab charged RM6 for the trip but I paid RM0, nice!
<br>
<br>
Checked in around 9:30pm. 
<br>
The place looks great for $19 ($18.65) to be exact....

They have separate dorms for Ladies and Gents. The Ladies Dorms' main door is password protected, so its safe from unauthorized people, mainly from Gents dorm. 
<br>
They will give you this bag which have a towel, key, toothbrush and earplug. You'll have to return this with the used towel to get back your RM50 deposit.

As a traveller myself, Ive learned how to make ways to safeguard your belongings specially when checking in on hostels with no privacy and security for your stuff.
<br>
Bought this anti-theft backpack from [pacsafe](https://int.pacsafe.com/) many years back.

<br>
And if you decided to leave it in your bed for the day, make sure that Its attached to any object that is unmovable.

Over all, this place is recommendable. 
<br>
Locationwise âœ…
<br>
Moneywise âœ…
<br>
Cleanliness âœ…
<br>
<br>
And oh! did I mention that they have free coffe and/or tea in the house? Yes ðŸ˜Œ
<br>
I was too tired already last night to go out for a meal, after all those queueing... So i just had tea before bed.
