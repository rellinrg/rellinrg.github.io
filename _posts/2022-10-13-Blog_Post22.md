---This is an update after using it yesterday for the first time---
<br>
In terms of running around in the beach sands - Its great , better than my old beach shoes as its sole is thicker but a lot of sand has got in on the shoes while I was playing. Im not sure if its because the shoes is big enough or I havent lock the shoe lace tight enough... hmmm, maybe Ill try the latter next game 🤔
