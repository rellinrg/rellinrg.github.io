I have noticed that this lump of my back is starting to be painful to touch now.
<br>
I am getting a little worried. 
<br>
Few years back, there's no lump on it
<br>
It was a little bump, that has this black kind of stuff that we managed to pull out.
<br>
<br>
<!--more-->
Occassionally it reoccur and we pull it out again. 
<br>
Don't really know what it is
<br>
As I was living alone for few many years, I didn't really noticed it there
<br>
Then it became some kind of lump, I just ignored it coz its not really painful and all
<br>
Now, when my back hits any wall, it touches the lump, so i felt the pain now
<br>
<br>
I'll have to plan for a doctors visit on this.
<br>
Hopefully its not bad... cross fingers ü§ûüèº
