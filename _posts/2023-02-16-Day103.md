My business partners are making me crazy. I am so stressed out…
Honestly I dont know why I let myself so affected.
Back and forth communication with them is draining me mentally.
My patience is getting this  small🤌🏻👊🏼
Muting them for now coz really I cant.

Cycling from work, I put my mind off a little bit.  
<br>
I just had the chance to reflect on my self. 
<br>
While paddling my pedal, my mind is afloat. 
<br>
I feel like Im barely living.
<br>
All along, Its more on just surviving.
<br>
I am feeling down and down again. 
<br>
I guess stress and hormones just doesn’t go along. 
<br>
Feelings just sucks. And I need a beer 😔
