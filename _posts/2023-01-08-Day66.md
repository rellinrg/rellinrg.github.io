<br>
This is a Filipino delicacy, a rice cake made of glutinous rice 
<br>
mixed with a bit of lye water, wrap in banana leaves and then boiled in water.  
<br>
I grew up eating this either for breakfast or afternoon snacks.
<br>
My taste buds is still craving for this once in a while
<br>
<br>
<br>
My lights in the bedroon is not working too. 
<br>
Not too sure if the problem is the lights which might needs replacement or the electricals
<br>
Coz its just too coincidental that both lights are not working at the same time.
