<br>
is a Filipino delicacy of glutinous rice 
<br>
mixed with a bit of lye water, 
<br>
wrap in banana leaves and then boiled in water.  
<br>
I grew up eating it either for breakfast or afternoon snack
<br>
<br>
<br>
She was doing a whole house cleaning. 
<br>
<br>
My lights in the bedroon is not working too. 
<br>
Was waiting for the owner to check if the problem is the lights that need replacement or the electricals.
<br>
Its just coincidental that the 2 lights are not working at the same time.
