I am feeling under the weather

Its very cold and gloomy
<br>
Very windy and little rain so I have to leave my bike at work.
<br>
<br>

<br>
It was actually entertaining, never expected that.
<br>
I remembered watching "3 Idiots", 2009 Comedy-drama film, before which was a funny movie
<br>
This one is my first time watching an action-thriller film
<br>
Stunt wise, its kinda exaggerating but somehow comical.
<br>
It was entertaining. 
<br>
Somehow light'ens up my mood a little
<br>
<br>
<br>
Almost empty 😮
