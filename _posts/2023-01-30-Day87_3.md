I am feeling under the weather
<br>
Its very cold and gloomy
<br>
Very windy and little rain so I have to leave my bike at work.
<br>
<br>
Watched this Hindi movie in Shaw Nex "Pathaan"
<br>
It was actually entertaining, never expected that.
<br>
I remembered watching "3 Idiots", 2009 Comedy-drama film, before which was a funny movie
<br>
This one is my first time watching an action-thriller film
<br>
Stunt wise, its kinda exagerating but somehow comical
<br>
It was entertaining somehow
<br>
<br>
<br>
Almost empty 😬
