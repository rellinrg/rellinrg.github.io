📍 Singapore 📍
<br>
<br>
I am pushing myself to sign up as many as possible cycling events.
<br>
I am getting lazier by day not doing much exercise.
<br>
<br>
So I did sign up for 21 Days Challenge. Which ofcourse you have to cycle as much as possible for 21 days.
<br>
This usually starts every 1st of the month and ends on 21st of the month. 
<br>
This ended last month so basically this is a late post coz I forgot about it 😅
<br>
<br>
Heres the goal

<br>
But ofcourse, I can't squeeze so much time everyday on cycling
<br>
<br>
For October's Challenge, this distance is supposed to be for Millau Viaduct Bridge, FR

<br>
I only passed the 100KM mark with a total of 195.25KM,  ranking 142nd on the peoples who joined.
<br>
I should improve my distance on next 21st challeng 💪🏻
<br>
But i guess, i will do bad on this Month (November) coz of all the travels 😬
