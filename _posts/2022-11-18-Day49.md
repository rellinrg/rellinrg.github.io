📍 Singapore 📍

<br>
I am pushing myself to sign up as many as possible cycling events.
<br>
I am getting lazier by day not doing much exercise.
<br>
<br>
So I did sign up for 21 Days Challenge. Which ofcourse you have to cycle as much as possible for 21 days.
<br>
This usually starts every 1st of the month and ends on 21st of the month. 
<br>
This ended last month so basically this is a late post coz I forgot about it 😅
<br>
<br>
Heres the goal
