<br>
As I opened my door in my room,
<br>
I was embraced with a cold air...
<br> 
No, Its not the air when you feel thiers spirit embracing you,
<br>
but literally a cold air because I FORGOT TO OFF MY AIRCON when i left this morning 😩
<br>
yeah, I FORGOT! WTF is wrong with my memory!
<br>
Is this the "aging" stage? 
<br>
deymmmm
<br>
Anyways, so yeah, this is the 2nd time this month.
<br>
I have to prepare for a huge power bill this month 🤦🏻‍♀️
<br>
Aside from that, nothing much is happening today.
<br>
Typical working day...
<br>
Woke up at 6:30, Do a little bits and pieces at home
<br>
Prep some foods and leave around 8am
<br>
Finished at 6:30, weekly meeting was moved tomorrow so HURRAH! for today...
<br>
I didnt cycle this morning coz the weather forecast is 90% to 100% probability of rain
<br>
And actually it did rain, halfway while I was on the bus.
<br>
So Im glad I listened to my guts (and the forecast 🤭)
