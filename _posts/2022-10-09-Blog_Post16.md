<br>
WTF - like whatttttt daaaa F
<br>
I had a typo last night while posting my blog.
<br>
Redirecting an output to a file.
<br>
Well, it totally over-write my file!
<br>
My problem is, Its the wrong frickin file!
<br>
Its my script doing all git stuff, creating md file and posting.
<br>
Damn
<br>
Ill have to bring my laptop with me today to recreate the script while in the van on the way to Malaysia.
<br>
Oh well, what has been done, cant be undone. 
<br>
LESSON LEARNED
