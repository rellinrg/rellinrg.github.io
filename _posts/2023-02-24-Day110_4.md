Someone is picking up this extra tape-measure I've got!
<br>
So I told him that I'll be home by 7:30ish,
<br>
But have to stop over in Sheng-Shiong for a quick grocery.
<br>
And has to stop over in Hawker Shop to buy some mushroom soup and garlic bread meal.

Its a waste to miss the DBS cashback every friday, so I did.
<br>
I got it for $2.90 at eatero which is not bad you know...
<br>
The mushroom soup is so mushroomy ðŸ˜„
<br>
But great....
