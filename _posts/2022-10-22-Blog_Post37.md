Padi Kopitiam

82-B1, Jalan Trus, Bandar Johor Bahru, 80000 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia
<br>
<br>
Its Day 1. 
<br>
Before Checking out in Attrus, I have to head out for breakfast.
<br>
I was planning to walk around the area but realized theres restaurant just beside Attrus.
<br>
I havent noticed it last night as I arrived late already. 
<br>
It looks like connected to the BnB so maybe the same owner?

After my late breakfast, I had a little walk around the area. Checking around whats there to see.
<br>
Maybe next time, I can try out other places.
<br>
I see CIQ hotel is nearby too. Ill try next time to experience the accomodation there.
<br>
<br>
I head back after a few minutes of walking and decided to maybe check-out early and bring my backpack out so that I dont need to come back to pick it up.
<br>
Just go jalan jalan and to the next hostel
<br>
<br>
A lil selfie before checking out 🤭 🤳

Selfie before I hurt my back 😵‍💫🤕
<br>
<br>
This blog is getting longer but i guess i need to include this for the record.
<br>
<br>
It happened when I was bending looking for the reciept while trying to lift up my backpack
<br>
Suddenly I feel a crack on my lower back - hip area...
<br>
THE WORST PAIN I EVER FELT
<br>
<br>
First time in my whole life I did encounter it.
<br>
I felt like blacking out. My eyesight became blurry and I felt my blood goes up in my head
<br>
Its a scary feeling.
<br>
At some point, I am deciding to go back home (in Singapore) right away.
<br>
<br>
I took a deep breath. 
<br>
No I wont...
<br>
Kaya ko to . Kakayanin ko to 💪
<br>
<br>
Felt manageable after rested for a little bit.
<br>
Still in pain but i think i can do it...
<br>
So here I am still 😓
<br>
I checked out already in Attrus
<br>
and on to the next location. 
<br>
It will be on my next blog kasi ang haba na ng entry ko 😂
