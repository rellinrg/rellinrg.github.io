Padi Kopitiam
<br>
82-B1, Jalan Trus, Bandar Johor Bahru, 80000 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia
<br>
<br>
Its Day 1. 
<br>
Before Checking out in Attrus, I have to head out for breakfast.
<br>
I was planning to walk around the area but realized theres restaurant just beside Attrus.
<br>
I havent noticed it last night as I arrived late already. 
<br>
It looks like connected to the BnB so maybe the same owner?

Padi Snowy Polo Bun

It so fluffy, soft and delicious. It's like roti boy but they bring it to the next level.

<br>
After my late breakfast, I had a little walk around the area. Checking around whats there to see.
<br>
Maybe next time, I can try out other places.
<br>
I see CIQ hotel is nearby too. Ill try next time to experience the accomodation there.
<br>
<br>
I head back after a few minutes of walking and decided to maybe check-out early and bring my backpack out so that I dont need to come back to pick it up.
<br>
Just go jalan jalan and to the next hostel
<br>
<br>
A lil selfie before checking out 🤭 🤳

Selfie before I hurt my back 😵‍💫🤕
<br>
<br>
This blog is getting longer but i guess i need to include this for the record.
<br>
<br>
It happened when I was bending looking for the reciept while trying to lift up my backpack
<br>
Suddenly I feel a crack on my lower back - hip area...
<br>
THE WORST PAIN I EVER FELT
<br>
<br>
First time in my whole life I did encounter it.
<br>
I felt like blacking out. My eyesight became blurry and I felt my blood goes up in my head
<br>
Its a scary feeling.
<br>
At some point, I am deciding to go back home (in Singapore) right away.
<br>
<br>
I took a deep breath. 
<br>
No I wont...
<br>
Kaya ko to . Kakayanin ko to 💪
<br>
<br>
Felt manageable after rested for a little bit.
<br>
Still in pain but i think i can do it...
<br>
So here I am still 😓
<br>
I checked out already in Attrus
<br>
and on to the next location. 
<br>
It will be on my next blog kasi ang haba na ng entry ko 😂
