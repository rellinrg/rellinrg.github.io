Padi Kopitiam

82-B1, Jalan Trus, Bandar Johor Bahru, 80000 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia
<br>
<br>
Its Day 1. 
<br>
Before Checking out in Attrus, I have to head out for breakfast.
<br>
I was planning to walk around the area but realized theres restaurant just beside Attrus.
<br>
I havent noticed it last night as I arrived late already. 
<br>
It looks like connected to the BnB so maybe the same owner?
