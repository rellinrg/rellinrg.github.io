Ive been dying to try this type of hair braiding for so long but certain someone doesnt agree, coz it looks awful 😬 
<br>👏🏼😃
<br>
<br>
There is a Salon just nearby our hotel which offer this service, so this time, I did 🤭
<br>
It cost about $35, I think its worth to try 🙂👌🏼
<br>
<br>
It took over an hour waiting to finish the process.
<br>
Done some food massage to ease my boredome too while waiting.
<br>
And it didnt disappoin me. I kinda like the result 👏🏼😃
