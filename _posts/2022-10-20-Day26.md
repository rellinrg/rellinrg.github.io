I recieved an email from HR today,
<br>
Informing us for an early release,
<br>
tomorrow at 4:30PM
<br>
Its going to be a long weekend!!!
<br>
In case you havenâ€™t noticed the lights along Serangoon Road, 
<br>
itâ€™s Deepavali in Singapore! 
<br>
<br>
I know, I know. 
<br>
I should explore around in Singapore and celebrate Diwali
<br>
But nah ðŸ˜¥, I need a breather...
<br>
I have been thinking lately on how I missed backpacking
<br>
So this,  this is it....
<br>
Unexpected, Unplanned & Spontanious travel...
<br>
So its set... I'll gonna pack my bag tonight and set off after work tomorrow
<br>
... ðŸŽ’
