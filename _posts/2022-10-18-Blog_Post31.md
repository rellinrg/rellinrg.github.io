<br>
Over the last few days of blogging, It is without a doubt one of the important part or routine that I do for myself.
<br>
This is not because I am enjoying writing, or more so story telling. 
<br>
I find it difficult to describe "the most important thing" 
<br>
Its the feeling of me mental offload and catharsis that came with it.
<br>
I seem to remember my days more clearly.
<br>
The act of sitting down at the end of the day, pondering, trying to rememer "what happened today?" forced me to reflect about my day.
<br>
My brain is such a mess that even the smallest thing I easily forget.
<br>
So instead, I just write a short sentences to describe my day or atleast the most relevant. 
<br>
Most of my entries are actually quite boring. 
<br>
Mostly beach tennis, cycling, golfing, work and etc
<br>
But its the days that I find something to latch on. 
<br>
Being able to go back and reminisce where I was a week ago, a month ago or even years ago, is an eye opening.
<br>
Im sure it is a habit that I will stick with for a long time
<br>
