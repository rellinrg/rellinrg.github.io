<br>
It was lost for about 3 weeks
<br>
I never thought, It will be found
<br>
<!--more-->
Weighing about things, I really never plan of buying a replacement either,
<br>
As its very rare that I use it for a call, 
<br>
It was.... back then....
<br>
<br>
So I'm glad that It was found,
<br>
No, It wasn't lost at all,
<br>
It was just there all along.
