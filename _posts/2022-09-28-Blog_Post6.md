<br>
So I decided to start biking to work again. It's been a long time I did it.
<br>
I wasn't physically fit at that time so I felt it was exhausting but this time I guess It wasn't bad.
<br>
I reached the office faster than my normal daily commute. 
<br>
Reached earlier than my normal arrival at office too!
<br>
So hopefully I can push this through every day. 
<br>
AJA!
