Vietnamese lunch today! 
<br>
So other of the lunchmates were on a team lunch,
<br>
actually farewell lunch for KP so only Clair & myself on lunch time.
<br>
<br>
Instead of going to Ciyuan hawker shop, for the friday cashback promo from dbs paylah,
<br>
We decided to have lunch in Singtel building.
<br>
It's been a while I had lunch there too,
<br>
So I ordered my all time and only meal I eat everytime we are in Singtel 👌🏼
<br>
<br>
.... And brought along nexpresso coffe with me (Intensity 13) ! 
<br>
coz im too sleep today ☕
