<br>
So since my back hurts, I dont have any schedule for the night.
<br>
I need to rest it a bit, I hope it will be better tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
I haven't done much today tho.
<br>
Aside from my painful back, the weather was not good in the afternoon.
<br>
<br>
After checking in on my 2nd accomodation, I walk out to explore the area.
<br>
its very near to Larkin Station.
<br>
Since the rain started pouring, I decided to explore inside Larkin Sentral

<br>
Also Marrybrown
<br>
First time Ive seen this fastfood name or maybe I did before but "wapakels" 
<br>
Marrybrown Sdn Bhd is a Malaysian-based halal-certified fast food restaurant chain established in 1981. It was the first local fast food chain to franchise its business in Malaysia with more than 198 restaurants locally
<br>
ok, it was even older than me 😄

Seems like this blogging thing pushed me to be aware of my sorroundings now 🤣
<br>
And wait!
<br>
theres also "my all time favorite ~ Dunkin Donuts"  outlet too.
<br>
Good to know! I might pop up tomorrow for a Bavarian 🥳🍩
<br>
<br>
Not dessert for now,
<br>
I was looking for a cafe that i can chill and set down, eat a filling meal (meaning with RICE) while waiting for the rain to stop.
<br>
<br>
and bwala! found this coffeshop "RICHIAMO COFFEE" near the entrance
<br>
<br>
AND they serve rice! Thats like hitting 3 birds with 1 stone

<br>
I had Nasi Daging Masak Hitam and Salted Caramello Cappuccino. I was asking the cashier what it is, he just said its beef, like beef with pepper 
<br>
I googled it, and it translated as Beef Curry in Black Sauce. Whatever name it is, Im ok coz first, its beef and 2nd, Its not spicy 🤪

<br>
Beef taste good but a bit too hard to chew, but its ok. Walang matigas na baka sa nangangalab na sikmura 😂
<br>
<br>
Salted Caramello on the other hand is DELISHHHHH ... 10/10 👍
