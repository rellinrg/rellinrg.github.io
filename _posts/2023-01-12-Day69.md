Day 12 of 2023
<br>
<br>
What was new? 
<br>
<br>
I cycled to work today. It takes 12 days for me this year to restart my year, cycling!
<br>
Hey Atleast I am back at it 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
<br>
Also done my shopping last night for pasalubong.

<br>
After doing shopping, stopped over in Virtualand. It is like timezone too with all those arcade games. 
<br>
Tried a couple of games like those drums, dance revo, basketball and forgot the name of that game where you have to shoot some animals in a ride 🤔  
<br>
But I enjoyed most is the basketball game. I forgot how destressing it is.
<br>
I use to join a basketball game in school Intramurals when I was in secondary school.
<br>
I enjoyed it, I was just not given with a good height to start with so I have a hard time with tall opponents 🥲
<br>
Those were the days...sigh....
<br>
<br>
<br>
Speaking of packing, I decided to just boxed my baggage instead of putting it in a lugguage.
<br>
I didnt bought an extra check-in baggage coming back to Singapore as I dont have anything to bring back. 
<br>
Will be back only with backpack so I think Its a waste of $$ to purchase an extra baggage.

All prepared...
<br>
I just need to do a final pack later for my handcarry items.
