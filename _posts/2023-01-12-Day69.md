Day 12 of 2023
<br>
<br>
What was new? 
<br>
<br>
I cycled to work today. It takes 12 days for me this year to restart my year cycling
<br>
Atlease I am back at it.
<br>
<br>
Also done my shopping last night for pasalubong.

<br>
<br>
And packed it all. I decided to just boxed it instead of putting in a lugguage 
<br>
Coz I didnt bought an extra baggage coming back to Singapore
<br>
Will be back only with backpack so I think Its a waste of $$ to purchase extra.
