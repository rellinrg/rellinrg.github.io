📍 Pavilion Surf Club 📍
<br>
<br>
After our walk around, we found a nice place to have a seat, lunch and relax.
<br>
This restaurant is fronting the beach so the sea wind is quite nice.
<br>
Janice is in a hurry tho coz they booked an appointment for body massage at 3PM. 
<br>
I dont feel like doing one yet. I feel like Its good to do the massage after any tiring activity.

Thier hawaiaan pizza taste good, not the normal hawaiian kind of taste 👌🏼🤤🍕
