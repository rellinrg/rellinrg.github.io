Day 16 of 365 y 2023
<br>
Days passed by so fast. 4 days in Cebu was gone just like that!
<br>
Its nice to meet family and relatives, and escape the stressful environment of work
<br>
Lately, I feel like life is passing me by 😔
<br>
For some reasons, going back to my root makes it a little lighter.
<br>
Making myself busy and explore places and things cover the feeling and thoughts temporarily
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I really had a hard time getting our transport out of DECA Homes
<br>
We need to get 2 cabs for my mom to Mambaling, my sisters to her home and for myself to go in my condo.
<br>
Our home in DECA is usually where we gather all together just that this place is a bit far from the highway
<br>
So transport is very hard to get
<br>
<br>
<br>
Everytime I leave, everyone has to leave the house too and go back in different places.
<br>
But possibly next month, my 2nd sibling would be able to live there with her family and look after the place.
<br>
<br>
<br>
So yeah, we didnt get a cab going out so my sister was introducing me this app for booking motorbike
<br>
This is just nice if I am not carrying a big bulky items which is just good coz I only have backpack and a handcarry bag with me.
<br>
Its not so bad actually coz its cheaper than getting a cab also, plus its easier to pass by on traffics.

After my final packing, I book another motorbike to the airport
<br>
Its a quick ride! Why didnt I know about this before?

<br>
Also had a quick meetup with Jacky in Bos Coffe in Airport
<br>
I havent seen her for a long time ever since she left Singapore for good
<br>
A quick catch up and update about our lives
<br>
<br>
<br>
Messy look and all, I aint going to put any filters on my pictures, What you see is what you get 
<br>
Embracing the mess that I become 😅
