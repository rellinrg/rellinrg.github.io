Today is a surf day! 🏄🏻‍♀️
<br>
It was 7 years ago, the last time weve been in Bali with my friends Nemie and Melai
<br>
On January of 2015, We had our first taste of surfing. It was really fun.
<br>
The 2nd time we did was on April of 2016 which was still so long ago. So this time would be my 3rd time!
<br>
I contacted our old friend Wayan for a refresher on surfing so he will pick me up today in our hotel.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I quickly grab something first before Wayan will pick me up. The hotel breakfast timing is 7:30-10:30 - I was the first one to be there at 7:21am 🤭
