<br>
Only 4 people sign up to play today including the organizer
<br>
Luckily no one backed out to get the quorom.
<br>
<br>
We finished setup the net about 5pm and started to play.
<br>
A round robin pairing, everyone plays with everyone
<br>
It wasnt bad at all. 
<br>
<br>
We did 5 games and 4 sets per game.
<br>
It was a good practice
<br>
<br>
My knee joints seems to be painful tho. Looks like due to a lot of diving on the sand ðŸ˜¬
<br>
Hopefully wont get worst
