<br>
Only 4 people sign up to play today including the organizer
<br>
We finished setup the net about 5pm and started to play.
<br>
We did a round robin pairing, everyone plays with everyone
<br>
Wasnt bad at all. 
<br>
We did 5 games , 4 sets per game.
<br>
Its a good practice game.
<br>
My knee joints seems to be painful tho. Looks like due to a lot of diving on the sand ðŸ˜¬
<br>
Hopefully wont get worst
