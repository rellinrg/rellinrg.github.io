Elly and I decided to go together to the BBQ venue in Bayshore after Beach Tennis. 
<br>
Its the first time that I joined Beto’s organised BBQ. 
<br>
<br>
We had showered first in ECP and planned to rent out a bike and cycle there. 
<br>
I end up installing “anywhere” app to rent a bike too.
<br>
<br>

We cycled for 24 minutes and a 3.95KM in distance and walk to the back gate of Bayshore. 
Embarassing thing is, I was so confident in telling Elly that I know the place and I'll lead the way,
<br>
but I end up wrong and we ended up tail gaiting in a wrong condo’s back gate! 
<br>
We walked around there looking for BBQ pit 8 & 9 and there wasn’t 🫢
<br>
<br>
At the end, Beto sent us a map and Elly lead the way this time. 
<br>
We had a big round on that condo and map was pointing out in the next condo building so we gone out in backdoor again and walk in thenext building's back door. 
<br>
<br>
We’ve been waiting for someone to go in or exit but its so quite. No people around! 
<br>
Its creepy and dark… 
<br>
I tried to peek on the gate and suddenly it pushed open, what the !!! 
<br>
Is it just luck or some creepy ghost around 😱👻
<br>
I would never gonna come in this kind of shortcut way alone, thats Im sure...

<br>
Anyways, we managed to find our way in the BBQ area. 
<br>
We see Beto while still walking there so its positive that It is the correct place this time.
<br>
<br>
Beto and his wife Lily is there. 
<br>
Also I just known that Ivan was living in the same building so they are the host. 
<br>
We Meet a random people also that is not from Beach Tennis 
<br>
so basically Beto invited also some of his other group like coffee group 🤔
<br>
It was OK night though.
<br>
In the beginning, I felt awkward really mingling coz I dont really know how to start a conversation.
<br>
I am still not so used of talking to peoples. 
<br>
It exhaust me. But Christina, Ivan’s 13 year old daughter is superb 🤩
<br>
I will literally never forget her. 
<br>
Its the first time that I encounter so sweet and good host. 
<br>
I’ve literally tried all the potluck foods there coz she’s very good in serving the food and make them want to try and say yes 😄. 
<br>
Very polite and sweet girl.
<br>
We were like, “Can we bring her to any of our events?” 😂

<br>
Around 10++, Me and Elly decided to leave. 
<br>
She is staying in Bukit Panjang area which is quite far, and she need to catch the blue lines MRT from Bugis.
<br>
Luckily for me, there is Bus 48 which goes to Serangoon MRT and I can change bus from there.
<br>
It was quite an experience with getting lost around.
