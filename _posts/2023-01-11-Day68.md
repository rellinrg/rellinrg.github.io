I seem to wake very early these days.
<br>
Today woke at 5:30, my mind is wandering around so early.
<br>
Naglatagaw lang ba.
<br>

I decided to start packing for my trip to Cebu tomorrow.
<br>
I did book a flight without any baggage for less than $300,
<br>
But now, I change my mind, I might add on a baggage for one-way SG-Cebu.
<br>
<br>
My mom asked me to bring some items that are liquid,
<br>
So theres no way I can carry it on with me 🤦🏻‍♀️
<br>
I'll have to fork out another $61.50 for additional 20KG minimum of baggage.
<br>
<br>
Since Ill have a 20KG extra, I might as well bring some kitchen/House Items that I wont be needing here
<br>
<br>
Slowly letting go of personal items specially expensive ones felt heavy,
<br>
We just have to bear in mind that these things doesnt add any meaning into our lifes
<br>
Maybe before, but not anymore.
<br>
I have to fully let go of material stuffs and live with less and frugal lifestyle.
