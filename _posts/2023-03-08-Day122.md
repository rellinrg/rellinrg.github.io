Another decluttering day...
<br>
I had 2 of these [Ikea LERBERG shelf](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/lerberg-shelf-unit-dark-grey-60186401/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=surfaces&utm_campaign=shopping_feed&utm_content=free_google_shopping_clicks_Storeandorganisefurniture&gclid=Cj0KCQiAx6ugBhCcARIsAGNmMbjXfKNP9p3Q7_Z_SL2kqixYgS-KTNbJmzdtDfI-B9OILJfBDZufYQ8aAjNsEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) that I bought when I was renting in Changi before
<br>
I used to put a lot of live flowering plants on these shelves before
<br>
And now its time to let these go...
<br>
<br>
<!--more-->
I posted it directly in Carousell for free
<br>
And someone responded and wants to have it.
<br>
It will be picked up tomorrow
