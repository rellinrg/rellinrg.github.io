First time that I am trying Singapore's Famous "MALA"
<br>
It is directly at the left of Chinatown MRT exit C, and in front of peoples park complex door.
<br>
<br>
They go by weight and doesn't matter if its meat or vegetables. 
<br>
It is priced at $1.98 per 100g.
<br>
<!--more-->
Their soup based is pork broth 
<br>
You can either choose from mushroom, tomato or mala for the soup base.
<br>
<br>
<br>
What does mala in Chinese mean?
<br>
The word mala is a combination of the Chinese characters ma (麻), meaning "to numb," 
<br>
and la (辣), meaning "spicy." 
<br>
This "hot and numbing taste" is a flavor characteristic of Sichuan cuisine of southwestern China, 
<br>
a region whose food is known for being spicy.
