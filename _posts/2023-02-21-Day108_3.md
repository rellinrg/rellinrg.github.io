This is far most the best Thai Pork Basil that I've tried in Singapore.
<br>
Partnered with Mango Salad... YUMMY 👌🏼
<br>
It's the 2nd time I have tried this in Food Junction (4th floor) in Nex Mall
<br>
for $7.50 + $2.90 Mango Salad. Its Singa price though 🤑
<br>
Should try in Thailand one day for authentic thai flavor
