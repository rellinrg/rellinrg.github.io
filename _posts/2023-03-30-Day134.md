Like literally "draining"!
<br>
This week has been a painful week...
<br>
4 visits to the clinic
<br>
<!--more-->
Last Saturday I had to do an emergency (I & D)
<br>
It turns out that big lump which is hurting in my back is not just a cybaecious cyst
<br>
but also it develop a skin abscess.
<br>
When the Dr mentioned he was going to do a 2inch cut
<br>
I panic. I was scared. I was pleading.
<br>
I had in intense fear of sharp objects (aichmophobia)
<br>
And have the anxiety even just before getting an injection.
<br>
The doctor then just use a needle instead and tried making a small hole to drain the pus out
<br>
It was painful. 
<br>
I wasn't prepared ðŸ¤•

Life really is a constant battle to everything
