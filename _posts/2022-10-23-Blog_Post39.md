Yesterday is not really my day!
<br>
<br>
1st, I have hurt my back by noon before I checked out from ATTRUS BED AND BREAKFAST, 
<br>
<br>
then last night I was locked inside my room 🚪
<br>
<br>
like literally.... locked inside.

<br>
<br>
After few minutes of struggle, it managed to open 
<br>
And I was also in real struggle coz i need to pee 😬
<br>
<br>
I called the reception on my concern.
<br>
I dont wanna be locked up again inside!
<br>
The staff tried to fixed it... (for quite a long time)

<br>
But nope. After putting it back all, 
<br>
Its not locking anymore.
<br>
She has to video call his boss and all that.
<br>
<br>
She left me opened 
<br>
I mean she left me with the door opened for a long time 🤣🤣🤣
<br>
Problem is, room was like along the doorway to the rest room,
<br>
And everyone passing by can see me inside 
<br>
(well atleast on the doorknob hole)
<br>
And guess what? I didnt care 🤷🏻‍♀️
<br>
I have experience worst than this on my backpacking journey, so were cool.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was waiting for so long for the boss to personally fix it. 
<br>
But no, I had to come down and follow up in the reception.
<br>
The guy (I think he was the manager) said he will fix later.
<br>
Later?  Im sleeepy! I said.
<br>
I wasn't ranting, I was just stating a fact to him. Its almost midnight!
<br> 
He eventually came and brought his paraphernalia
<br>
Good thing i bought a can of guinness before going back in my room last night. 
<br>
So I can be "chill" while dealing all these 😎
<br>
Everything happened for a reason. (Thats my mantra)
<br>
<br>
So cheers to that 🍻
