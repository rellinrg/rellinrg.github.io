Yesterday is not really my day!
<br>
<br>
1st, I have hurt my back by noon before I checked out from ATTRUS BED AND BREAKFAST 
<br>
<br>
then last night I was locked inside my room 🚪
<br>
<br>
like literally.... locked inside.

<br>
After few minutes of struggle, it managed to open 
<br>
(I was also struggling coz i need to pee 😬)
<br>
It was broken 😑
<br>
<br>
The staff tried to fixed it... (for quite a long time)

But nope. After putting it back all, 
<br>
Its not locking anymore.
<br>
She has to video call his boss and all that.
<br>
<br>
She left me opened 
<br>
I mean she left me with the door opened for a long time 🤣🤣🤣
<br>
My room was like the doorway to the rest room
<br>
And everyone passing by can see me inside (well atleast on the door knob hole)
<br>
And guess what? I didnt care.
<br>
I have experience worst on my backpacking journey
<br>
<br>
<br>
It took so long for the right man to fix the door. I had to come down and follow up in the reception.
<br>
The guy (I think he was the manager) said he will fix later.
<br>
Its almost midnight, Im sleeepy!
<br>
He eventually came and brought his paraphernalia
<br>
Good thing i bought a can before going back in my room last night. 
<br>
So I can be "chill" while dealing all these 😎
<br>
Everything happened for a reason. (Thats my mantra)
<br>
<br>
So cheers to that 🍻
