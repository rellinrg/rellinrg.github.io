<br>
Had to see Dr again today as my back is really painful
<br>
Its affecting my sleeping position already.
<br>
<br>
DR was asking me if I wanted to do the surgery na 
<br>
but I told him that I have a consultation scheduled in Poly Clinic on April 1
<br>
So He just then proceeded to prescribe me with antibiotics and pain reliever.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully It will feel a little better before Ill have my consultation in poly clinic
