<br>
Almost completed my medication prescribed by my doctor
<br>
But for some reason, my throat seems to be worsen.
<br>
Somehow my right side throat, the pain seems to be connected to the left ear
<br>
It worries me a little,
<br>
This same symptoms happened to me on November
<br>
I wonder if the same type of bacteria or virus that causes this.
<br>
I remember my doctor mentioned last time that its attacking the right side of my throat
