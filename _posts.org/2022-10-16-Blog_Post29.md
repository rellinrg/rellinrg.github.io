<br>
I feel better today. Headache gone after a good rest last night.
<br>
Woke up at 5am coz of a loud thug of thunder.
<br>
Tried to squeeze myself under my comfy sheet to get back to sleep and I did.
<br>
Did a covid test again in the morning when I woke up.
<br>
I felt like I had a fever last night but maybe just due to dehaydration - too much sun yesterday.
<br>
I was paranoid, much more thinking that I was with a lot of friends.
<br>
Im much more scared for the people around me rather than myself
<br>
Its not a good feeling to be somones cause of covid yah know, I cant bear it.
<br>
My test was negative this morning so Its a  relief...
<br>
Seems like it will be a rainy day today.
<br>
A cheesy cassava cake will be nice.
<br>
Maybe ill make one 💁🏼‍♀️🍮
