Talking to you, talking to me all about you, about your life, whats going on there,
<br>
without even noticing my pain is just devastating....

I am a little energize today. Its been a long time ever since i felt emotionally attached to anyone again.
<br>
I think this is just a passing phase.
<br>
I have to wake up and face reality.
<br>
Be positive and focus on SELF LOVE....
